CHAPTER I</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Roderick Barclugh</span> was invited to dine with
the FitzMaurices and Benedict Arnold was to
meet him.</p>

<p>The arrival in Philadelphia of a gentleman with
credentials from Dr. Franklin to the Secretary of
Congress, who had much influence with the French
Court, and who had bills of exchange for twenty
thousand pounds sterling created stirring comment
among the fashionables. He was to meet without
delay the choice spirits on the inside of Philadelphia&#8217;s
aristocratical party.</p>

<p>Robert FitzMaurice&#8217;s mansion, to which had
been made great additions, to suit the tastes of
the new proprietor, was an old Colonial landmark.
The ambition of this merchant prince
and financier had ever been to establish his family
and his fortunes under the English system of
aristocracy, upon such a grand scale of magnificence
that he could claim all the blandishments of a
crest and a title which, of course, belong to a
person of substance. His entertainments were
numerous, and there gathered all the intriguers
in and out of Congress,&mdash;those who sanctioned
the Revolution on political grounds but who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
shuddered at the utterance of the word &#8216;democracy.&#8217;
The clergy, the judiciary, the lawyers,
the knights-errant and the financiers, found
congenial atmosphere and hospitality in this
house; for schemes were there laid to win independence,
but, once won, the English Constitution
and its institutions of aristocracy and finance
were the only safeguards of prosperity and liberty
which the common people should consider.</p>

<p>Upon the occasion of the dinner for Roderick
Barclugh, the guests most suitable for an affair
of such financial and political importance were
to be Judge Shippen and his charming daughter,
Bessie; General Arnold and his bride, formerly
Miss Peggy Shippen; Reverend Mr. White, Rector
of St. Peter&#8217;s and brother to Mrs. FitzMaurice;
Thomas Milling and Mrs. Milling; Mr. Wilson,
a lawyer, and chief coadjutor in aristocratic
plans. Besides the foregoing, Colonel Hamilton,
the aide of General Washington, being in Philadelphia
on business, and Roderick Barclugh
completed the list of the older set. A bevy of
young and attractive belles of the day were
invited to give spirit to the party. These were
Miss Chew, daughter of Judge Chew, a suspected
Tory; Miss Logan, a representative of an old
and distinguished Quaker family; and Miss
Greydon, a beauty and wit, who, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was the only personage present of advanced
democratic belief.</p>

<p>At half-past five the coach-and-four of General
Arnold rolled into the <i>porte cochere</i> of the FitzMaurice
mansion, and the General, dressed
with wine-colored coat and knee breeches, buckles
and velvet waistcoat, lace frills in his sleeves and
bosom, gallantly escorted his young and brilliant
wife up the steps into the spacious hallway.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh arrived with Mr. Wilson
in the latter&#8217;s carriage. Liveried lackeys bowed
and scraped at every turn as the guests arrived
and retired to the dressing-rooms, and afterwards
presented themselves to the hostess and host
in the reception room. The elegant apparel
and polished manners of Roderick Barclugh
impressed everybody present with a feeling that
he was a man of affairs.</p>

<p>As General Arnold came into the room bearing
on his arm Mrs. Arnold,&mdash;blushing, beautiful
and <i>distingue</i>&mdash;, both stepping up urbanely to
greet the hostess and host, Roderick Barclugh
read family domination in the hauteur and firm
mouth of the young dame.</p>

<p>As the hostess turned to Roderick Barclugh
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, may I present to you and
Mrs. Arnold, Mr. Barclugh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Roderick Barclugh bowed twice, very low,
and Mrs. Arnold took pains to say most cordially:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is with much pleasure we meet you, Mr.
Barclugh,&#8221; as she smiled most sweetly and passed
on to the other part of the room to greet friends.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton and Roderick Barclugh were
the only ones who were not intimately acquainted
with every one else, so the party at once took on
a most free and jolly air. The young ladies
at once lionized Colonel Hamilton, who was
a very popular beau of his time. Miss Greydon
was already making a few good-natured sallies
at the Colonel.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson held the attention of Roderick
Barclugh by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, Congress has had so many hot-headed
and rabid Democrats that the people
of wealth and substance in the Colonies have
dreaded the issue of the Revolution for fear
that the rabble and ignorance of the country
would rule,&mdash;in fact, I have no love for the so-called
inherent rights of the people, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why are the influential people of substance
encouraging the Revolution then, if they can see
nothing except disorder and anarchy result therefrom?&#8221;
was the inquisitive rejoinder of Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, those New England delegates under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Samuel Adams and the Southern delegates under
Thomas Jefferson were so rabid that Robert
FitzMaurice and myself and our party of conservatives
in the Continental Congress were
overwhelmed and compelled to sign the Declaration
of Independence. We did so reluctantly
and after a bitter contest, for the commercial and
Quaker interests of Philadelphia opposed the
declaration. If the commercial interests of our
country could have the decision, there would
have been no Declaration of Independence.
We would have settled our differences amicably
with King George, maintained our allegiance
to the British Crown, and held the Colonies
under the British Constitution,&#8221; was the dramatic
response of the Philadelphia lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and every one of you would bargain away
your rights as free men for the sake of so-called
commercial interests, which will breed a class
of tyrants more potent than kings,&#8221; was the
spirited retort of Miss Greydon, who had been
an attentive listener to the doctrines of an advocate
who, she knew, was paid for his opinions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, at politics already! Why it seems,
Mr. Barclugh, as though the Americans were
born for politics,&mdash;even the ladies have their
opinions,&#8221; laughingly remarked the host as he
offered his arm to Mrs. Milling, and then turned
to the guests with the words:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&#8220;James announces dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess escorted Mr. Barclugh to Mrs.
Arnold for her dinner partner, and General
Arnold to Miss Chew. Colonel Hamilton was
selected to accompany Miss Greydon, and the
Reverend Mr. White, Miss Logan. Mr. Wilson
offered his arm to Miss Shippen and then Mr.
Thomas Milling his to the Rector&#8217;s wife, Mrs.
White. The hostess graciously took the arm of
the eldest of the guests, Judge Shippen, and led
the party to table in the spacious dining-hall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold at once put Roderick Barclugh
at his ease by entering into a lively conversation.
Her young and gay spirits shone out serenely
as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish, Mr. Barclugh, that this horrid
war were ended, so that we could once more
live in peace and enjoy our homes and society.
Do you not think some good man could convince
the best Americans of the folly of their cause?
Why, I believe I could if I were a man,&#8221; as she
archly tossed her head smilingly toward her
escort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could charm them into your way of
thinking, madam, at all events. I believe seriously,
however, much might be gained for society by
such a course. Against such resources as the
Bank of England controls, this war does seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
a hopeless task,&#8221; concluded Barclugh.</p>

<p>At table the Reverend Mr. White invoked
the divine blessing upon the assembled guests
and prayed that &#8220;the havocs of war would cease
by the intercession of the divine wisdom; that
the mother country would be brought to a just
realization of the needs of the Colonies; and that
the Colonies would find their true welfare in the
safety and protection of the British Constitution
and laws,&#8221;&mdash;these were the sentiments of the
Chaplain of Congress expressed in private.</p>

<p>Mrs. FitzMaurice watched Colonel Hamilton&#8217;s
face to ascertain how these sentiments of her
reverend brother affected one so close to the
Commander-in-Chief, but seeing that the Colonel
was very enthusiastic in paying his gallantries
to the bevy of young ladies around him, she
became convinced that the British Constitution
had Hamilton&#8217;s good will.</p>

<p>The hostess turned to Colonel Hamilton, however,
and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Colonel, we know that you get to see
the young ladies very seldom from your camp,
but, come, do let us hear of the Commander-in-Chief,
and what the news is about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, madam, I beg your forbearance,&#8221;
replied Hamilton, &#8220;General Washington is quite
well, but he feels very much discouraged. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
complains bitterly about the principal men of
the Colonies being detained at home by private
and Colonial affairs, so that the responsible
positions of Congress have fallen into the hands
of incapable and indifferent men. Everything
drifts aimlessly along, while many of our able
men retire from Congress in order to prosecute
schemes for private gain instead of devoting
their energies to the welfare of the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert FitzMaurice took a lively interest in
the last few remarks and spiritedly replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I presume we ought to ruin ourselves
for the benefit of an irresponsible government.
Even though we gain our independence, the
government will be dominated by the rabid Whigs
in whom we can have no confidence. There
will be no stability of government under such
demagogues as Samuel Adams and Thomas
Jefferson. There will be no sound financial
system, nor anything for society to respect but
the rag-tag and bob-tail descended from everywhere
and kin to nobody.&#8221; As he concluded
the last sally, everybody joined in a general
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where could we expect to find any <i>grandes
dames</i> or any examples of gentlemen? We
know too well already what would become of a
nation ruled by shopkeepers and bushwhackers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I can see no virtue in the so-called schemes of
self-government; society could never submit to
such indignities. We would have to go to England
to escape from such a rabble,&#8221; was the bitter
homily of Mrs. Arnold, as she spoke in well
measured language, and showed the fire of her
dark eyes, and the charms of her long lashes and
beautiful neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, madam,&#8221; was the challenge of Mr.
Wilson, the lawyer, as he lifted his wine-glass,
and all the gentlemen followed to drink to the
sentiments of General Arnold&#8217;s blushing bride.</p>

<p>As the General drained his glass, he beamed
with satisfaction; the attention paid his bride
tickled the vanity of his nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced,&#8221; remarked Roderick Barclugh,
&#8220;that if all the ladies could so successfully convince
their friends, the war would soon be over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it will soon be over if Congress does
not change for the better the treatment of the
army,&#8221;&mdash;said Arnold, pointing to himself, while
everybody laughed. &#8220;There is no gratitude for
soldiers in a government by the people,&#8221; said
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will receive the plaudits of a great people,
as an heritage to your children, General,&#8221; slyly,
with a chuckle, put in Judge Shippen, his father-in-law.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, but applause does not buy bread and
butter and pay the bills, Judge,&#8221; was Arnold&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;But patriots should restrict their needs of
money for the sake of their country,&#8221; was the
advice of the Reverend Mr. White, the Rector of
St. Peter&#8217;s Church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, but patriotism, like patience, ceases
to be a virtue when one&#8217;s family must suffer
ignominiously as a consequence,&#8221; was the rejoinder
of the Commander of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear General,&#8221; said Miss Greydon,
&#8220;what would our cause do if it were not for the
sacrifices of our noble mothers, who say to their
sons: &#8216;Take this Bible and keep it in your
breast as your guide; care not for me. God
will care for the brave and true; pursue your
destiny and return not till the tyrant is driven
from our shores,&#8217;&mdash;like the Spartan mother
who said: &#8216;Come back with your shield or upon
it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Greydon,&#8221; said Arnold, &#8220;such
sentiment is very fine, but very poor business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! that&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it. There&#8217;s far
too much sentiment in our ideas of government,&#8221;
said the lawyer, Wilson. &#8220;Sentiment can never
overcome Britain&#8217;s power and wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that the dinner was well along, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Greydon saw that if any one was to show loyalty
to the cause of the Colonies at this gathering
of choice aristocratic spirits, she must assume
the task, thus she essayed to reply to the lawyer:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Wilson, the day will be a very sad
one for our government and for our countrymen
when we can surrender our cardinal virtues of
patriotism and self-denial in order to let personal
gain shape the destiny of our government. If
mere arms and money are more powerful than
the ideas of freedom, of equality and of justice,
then wealth and brute force will rule the world.
But if every true American stands firmly for self-government
and an independent system of finance
and our own social relations, Britain can never
conquer us. Our nation will prosper and put
Britons to shame for the selfishness and audacity
of their claims. Were I possessed of the powers
of an orator, I would not rest until our Colonies
were free to govern themselves in behalf of human
rights&mdash;not wealth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody looked toward Mrs. Arnold, and
those who knew her well expected an outburst
of her fiery nature, but the hostess, feeling it
was now time for the ladies to retire, arose and
interposed very gracefully:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better retire in favor of the
gentlemen, who can settle those questions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
state by means of wine and song.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner had the ladies gone, than the host
said to the butler at his side:</p>

<p>&#8220;James, you will now bring in the &#8216;jolly
mariner.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the head waiter appeared bearing a
huge punch-bowl laden with a concoction,&mdash;the
pride of the host. Besides slices of tropical
fruits and a foundation of rare old Burgundy,
it was made smooth with sugar and Jamaica rum.
Then by way of a backbone to &#8220;stiffen&#8221; it a
little, James had put in a good portion of <i>Cognac</i>.</p>

<p>General Arnold had already drunk with everybody
whom he could induce; he was just beginning
to feel his importance when the &#8220;jolly mariner&#8221;
arrived, and glasses were filled; then Arnold
gave vent to the toast nearest his heart. He
arose and proposed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s success to privateering.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing, everybody drank deeply to this
sentiment, for the host was enriching himself
on it, and Arnold hoped to support his extravagance
by it. The punch was so smooth that even
the old heads desired another bumper.</p>

<p>Old Thomas Milling, the head of the host&#8217;s
trading-firm, was now beginning to feel rather
mellow and when he reflected that privateering
smacked of the gay sea-rover he sang a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of stanzas of the old ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;My name was Captain Kidd,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When I sail&#8217;d, when I sail&#8217;d,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;My name was Captain Kidd,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When I sail&#8217;d, when I sail&#8217;d,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I roamed from sound to sound</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;And many a ship I found,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;That I sank or ran aground,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When I sail&#8217;d, when I sail&#8217;d;</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;That I sank or ran aground,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;When I sail&#8217;d, when I sail&#8217;d.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;By George, that punch has the magic in it,
Robert, to make Milling turn loose,&#8221; said Wilson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, Milling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Encore, encore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! We&#8217;ll have the next,&#8221; rang out a
medley of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well, gentlemen, if it pleases you,&#8221;
continued the old merchant:</p>

<div class="verse">&#8220;Farewell to young and old</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;All jolly seamen bold,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to my gold,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I must die, I must die.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome to my gold,</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I must die, I must die.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the gold, gentlemen, he says we&#8217;re
welcome&mdash;hic&mdash;to it,&#8221; said Arnold as he extended
a wobbling wine-glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Kidd must have been a bold rover
of the seas,&#8221; remarked Roderick Barclugh, &#8220;to
have been commissioned by the British Admiralty
to clear the seas of pirates and then to have
turned to the plundering himself. I rather admire
the audacity of character. His riches would
have made him a great man if he had escaped
the gallows, like many another before and since
his time. The riches are what we must have,
no matter so much how they come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, hear, gentlemen,&#8221; said Arnold, as
he stupidly raised his wine-glass and drank
again, &#8220;we <i>must</i> have the riches.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the butler came quietly into
the room and touching General Arnold on the
arm, delivered a message.</p>

<p>The Commander of Philadelphia took his
leave, and everybody smiled as he made extra
efforts to steady his steps out of the room.</p>

<p>While the gentlemen were discussing privateers
and the &#8220;jolly mariner,&#8221; the ladies had gone to
the drawing-room to have coffee served.</p>

<p>Mrs. FitzMaurice by an opportune retirement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the ladies from the table had evaded an impending
storm, for she had known Mrs. Arnold from
girlhood, and saw that a conflict of sentiment
between her and Miss Greydon was inevitable.
As the hostess had a premonition of the impending
clash, she thought best to have the scene among
the ladies alone, for they all knew the hysterical
temper of the General&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>As soon as the ladies had been seated at the
tables for coffee, Mrs. Arnold&#8217;s ire began to gather
headway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that examples
of the Spartan woman were good enough for the
common people, but for the gentry to give up
their birth-rights and fortunes, and to sacrifice
themselves and their future for a miserable system
of self-government, such statements are vulgar and
indecent. Why, just to think! General Arnold
asked the Committee on Military Affairs and
the Commander-in-Chief to be transferred to
the command of West Point, and thus far they
have ignored his request. Surely he deserves
<i>some</i> honors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Arnold, I believe the proper
thing to do, entertaining such sentiments toward
our principles of free government, instead of
seeking West Point, that General Arnold ought
to resign, or in fact join the other party,&#8221; flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
from Miss Greydon&#8217;s ready tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too much. I&mdash;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t stand it.
O General! O Papa! I must leave this room.
Somebody, somebody better come here,&#8221; shrieked
the General&#8217;s wife as the hostess led the unfortunate
lady to the dressing-room, and sent for
General Arnold.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bitterness</span> of feeling between the Tories and
Whigs was mollified in Philadelphia by the
gayety and social qualities of the French Minister.</p>

<p>M. de la Luzerne had rare social tact. He
flattered the Tories and dazzled the Whigs by
fine dinners and balls to which all factions were
invited. The <i>salon</i> of his residence was a favorite
meeting-place. Political feuds and family jars
were settled by the benign smiles and courtesy
of the host and hostess. Times were stirring;
the checker-board of war held sway in the drawing-room;
the social ills of the body politic were cured
by this representative of the French monarch,
and the Revolution prospered.</p>

<p>As the guests arrived, the liveried butler announced
their names in stentorian tones and
Mollie Greydon and her father, Dr. Greydon,
entered when the music was starting for the
cotillion. Roderick Barclugh met Mollie as she
came down the staircase, and announced to her
that she was to be his partner since her name by
lot fell to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have the pleasure of dancing with
you this evening, Miss Greydon?&#8221; Barclugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
asked her.</p>

<p>She had taken a parting glance in the mirror.
Her reflected <i>pompadour</i>, ribbons, and the lace
handkerchief around her sloping white shoulders
satisfied her. Her bodice was square-cut and
her head, which was stately, poised on a well-rounded
neck, added dignity to her well-formed
figure. When she appeared on the staircase
and approached Roderick Barclugh with a firm
but elastic step she felt perfectly calm and comfortably
gowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; replied Mollie
when asked to dance the cotillion, &#8220;I shall deem
it an honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her partner&#8217;s arm and bowed to Alexander
Hamilton, General Washington&#8217;s aide.
He was waiting to invite Mrs. Arnold for the
cotillion. Roderick Barclugh&#8217;s pulse beat fast
with delight, when he stepped into the ball-room,
filled with America&#8217;s choicest spirits. They swiftly
passed among the couples, seated in a semicircle,
waiting for the leader to start the dancing; then
they sat down, and he began to talk to his beautiful
partner.</p>

<p>Anne Milling, herself a belle, ran over to Mollie
and whispered,</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fortunate in your lot for a partner.
He is simply grand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Comte de Noailles was the leader of the
cotillion, and his selection of figures and favors
was both bold and unique. His art had been
learned at the French Court, and the Colonists
went into ecstacies over his innovations.</p>

<p>Both Mollie and Mrs. Arnold were dancing
in the first figure which was a complicated affair
requiring eight couples. Mrs. Arnold was standing
with her partner, Colonel Hamilton, watching
the others when she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just look at those eyes of Mr. Barclugh,&#8221;&mdash;and
she gave her head a saucy toss,&mdash;&#8220;he is
simply devouring that young Quakeress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know, my dear Madam,&#8221; said the
Colonel, &#8220;Miss Greydon has had a beautiful
life at Dorminghurst. She has cultivated the
classics and is gifted as a linguist. Those accomplishments
along with her personal charms are
reflected in every movement of her form, which
is beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Colonel, I am surprised to have you
express yourself so enthusiastically over that
young prodigy. She is too ordinary for me.
She makes a companion of a young Indian maiden
who lives on her father&#8217;s estate. I believe her
name is <i>Segwuna</i> and she has much influence
over Mollie. She also has ideas about the rights
of the people. So there! What can you expect?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
She knits for the soldiers, and attends the dairy
at Dorminghurst for her mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now! Now! Madam Arnold, you do not
feel ungrateful&mdash;&#8221; Hamilton began.</p>

<p>&#8220;For my life, I can not see what Mr. Barclugh
can see in a girl of her tastes!&#8221; interrupted the
General&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; argued the Colonel, &#8220;Mr. Barclugh
has seen the jaded life of rouge and power and
<i>effete ennui</i> in Paris and this young, beautiful
and surprising belle of our Colonies appeals
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel, you must be in love yourself,&#8221;
said Mrs. Arnold archly; &#8220;men are such untutored
creatures.&#8221; She laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Salut de la Court!</i>&#8221; called Comte de
Noailles, the leader.</p>

<p>The dancers began the merry round which
wound up with Mrs. Arnold being in the <i>promenade</i>
with Roderick Barclugh, and Colonel Hamilton
with Mollie Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a fine partner, Miss Greydon,&#8221;
remarked Hamilton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, do you think so?&#8221; asked Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the ladies are in ecstacies over him. It
is a new face and a title that attract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You misunderstand me then,&#8221; said Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are the exception that proves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
rule,&#8221; enjoined the Colonel, who was handsome
in his gay uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are men the infallible judges?&#8221; parried Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes to beauty,&#8221; replied the Colonel
gayly.</p>

<p>The figure changed and Mollie found herself
swinging in the arms of Roderick Barclugh and
out of breath she sat down with a swirl of satin
skirts that showed a dainty slipper.</p>

<p>Now Colonel Hamilton and Mrs. Arnold had
a chance for a <i>tete-a-tete</i> as she sat down with
a heaving breast which gave effect to her low-cut
corsage of black velvet. Her white hand
held a dainty fan which she used vigorously
as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you something about Roderick
Barclugh. He will some day have a title, and he
is seeking his fortune in privateering. He is
engaged in this business along with FitzMaurice
and Milling, and has twenty thousand pounds
sterling to his credit with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how do you happen to know so much
about him,&#8221; asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold told me. They have some
business ventures in privateering together. You
know, we do not get enough from Congress
for our station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true, Madam, but your lot is cast with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a man of arms and he must take the fortunes
of war,&#8221; said Alexander Hamilton sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Colonel, you are so severe!&#8221; exclaimed
the General&#8217;s wife as John Milling came up
and favored her with the next figure in the cotillion.</p>

<p>Little did Mollie and Barclugh know that they
were the observed of all observers in the ball-room.
The French Minister came up to them
and shook his finger slyly at Barclugh and said:
&#8220;<i>Une fille par excellence de la belle France</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh colored slightly and rose to give the
host a chance to speak to Mollie and bowed very
low. He then made his way to the side of Madam
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is so sweet of you, <i>ma chere</i>, to grace
our assembly with your presence,&#8221; smilingly
remarked the fat and jolly minister, while rubbing
his hands together nervously. &#8220;My compliments
to your mama,&#8221; continued the diplomat, &#8220;but
look out and do not lose your heart to my countryman,
Mr. Barclugh. He is very gay, very gay.&#8221;
He then passed on to General Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;No dancing for you, <i>mon cher general</i>, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Certainment! Certainment!</i>&#8221; replied the diplomat
as the General pointed to his wounded knee,
a relic of Saratoga.</p>

<p>Mollie now had a chance to pause for a few
minutes from the gay whirl of the dance, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
she wished that she had never been allowed
the opportunity. She grew pale as she saw
Roderick Barclugh talking with Mrs. Arnold
in a confidential manner. There was just one
nod of her head that spoke volumes to Mollie.
Hot and cold tremors coursed through her veins,
for she could not fathom Mrs. Arnold, therefore
she was a mystery to her and Mollie did not like
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Tuesday, then?&#8221; queried Mrs. Arnold
in a voice above the music of the dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuesday,&#8221; nodded Barclugh in reply, just
loud enough for Mollie to hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Miss Mollie,&#8221; came from Barclugh
as he took his seat, &#8220;I was just making an appointment
to ride out with the Commandant and his
wife next Tuesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply, but looked displeased.</p>

<p>The intermission for refreshments ensued, and
instead of going directly to the tables where
the coffee and chocolate were served, Barclugh
and Mollie continued their <i>tete-a-tete</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I missed your presence so much at Dorminghurst
when we had our last tea party, Mr.
Barclugh,&#8221; said Mollie with much emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am flattered, Miss Greydon,&#8221; was all Barclugh
could reply. His manner was agitated.</p>

<p>Barclugh did not know why this mere girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
should have such an influence upon him. She
was a surprise to his soul. Used to the artificial
manners of the French Court he could not believe
his own eyes when he beheld such grace of person,
stately courtesy and dignity in any living being
as the one before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you know, I do not give flattery,&#8221; flashed
from the pretty lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, if I stayed away from your tea party
you would not care for that?&#8221; queried Barclugh
with intensity in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but you know that I said &#8216;I missed you,&#8217;&#8221;
answered Mollie with a merry glance over the
top of her fan.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Comte de Noailles happened
along and urged on the dancers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! Here! We need you. Get your partners
for the country reel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh and Mollie stopped their confidences
and laughed heartily at each other as they hurried
to the refreshment table and returned with glee
for the reel.</p>

<p>The Comte danced with Anne Milling and
led the couples out into the middle of the floor.
Eight couples faced each other and the reel
began.</p>

<p>&#8220;First couple forward and back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Second couple the same!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>The young now had their chance and
the dowagers and the old macaronis filled up
the ball-room and looked on with zest and zeal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold while dancing with her partner,
Colonel Hamilton, could not keep her eyes from
Roderick Barclugh and Mollie. She was simply
desperate to think that her sister, Bessie, did not
have Barclugh for her evening&#8217;s partner. She
watched the expression on Barclugh&#8217;s face as
he bowed and swung in the changes of the dance,
and she was so preoccupied that when the Comte
called:</p>

<p>&#8220;First couple up and down the center!&#8221;&mdash;she
did not recognize her partner&#8217;s bow until in self-defense
Colonel Hamilton said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Madam!&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled with her inattention she blushed guiltily
and took the proffered hand of Colonel Hamilton
and promenaded up and down between the
lines to the rhythm of the violins and the clapping
of hands.</p>

<p>As the turn for Mollie and Barclugh came, it
was noticeable to all how Barclugh beamed with
pride as he led Mollie, with her hand raised high,
and in dainty step passed between the merry
dancers. He bowed deferentially as they turned
to retrace their steps. Mollie looked all aglow
as she stood <i>vis-a-vis</i> to Barclugh. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
intoxication in her manner, her face was illumined
with success, but no one recognized this triumph
of Mollie Greydon with such envy as Mrs. Arnold.
She could not bear to think Barclugh was lost
from <i>her</i> influence.</p>

<p>The reel concluded with the Comte bowing
and courtesying to the onlookers as they applauded.
He gave the call for the last figure:</p>

<p>&#8220;All join hands forward and back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Salute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh swung his partner with an abandon
that Mollie could not resist, and then escorted
her to Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>When Mollie had seated herself he finished the evening’s pleasure by
saying to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;The dance is the language of love.&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">On the</span> morning after the assembly Barclugh
awoke as though from a dream. After leaving
the French Minister&#8217;s mansion he went to his
bachelor&#8217;s quarters on Front Street and sat in
his chair trying to dispel the pictures of Mollie
Greydon. Reason as he might&mdash;that she was
a mere girl and he a man of the world, and he
ought not to allow his fancy to dwell upon affairs
of his heart when he had sterner duties to perform&mdash;still
the image of that being who had awakened
a new life for him clung to his brain and he could
not forget it. It gave him no rest.</p>

<p>But the morning of the following Thursday
when he was to see her again, he bounded out of
bed and felt as though he could not wait for the
hour to arrive. To take the carriage to Dorminghurst
was his overpowering desire.</p>

<p>The old Colonial mansion of Dorminghurst
had been the scene of many brilliant receptions;
but this one, when Mollie felt that her fate was
to be settled, seemed of far-reaching influence.
The servants arranged the china and the tea-urn
on a round mahogany table in the center
of the drawing-room. Tables and chairs arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for groups of ladies and gentlemen to sit around
and sup their tea and gossip, were placed in the
corners of the large room. Mollie was taking
a last look at her gown when she heard the first
carriage rattle along the roadway and came
down the grand staircase to take her place with
her parents.</p>

<p>The Greydons held a position of unquestionable
influence in the upper society of Philadelphia.
James Greydon, Mollie&#8217;s grandfather, had been
Secretary of William Penn, the founder; then
deputy Governor, then executor of Penn&#8217;s vast
landed estate. Consequently, the Greydons were
lordly proprietors, for the thrifty grandfather
had bought his lands from the Indians. Thus
a card for a reception at Dorminghurst became
almost a command.</p>

<p>On this serene afternoon in May the broad
avenue of hemlocks seemed more beautiful than
ever. The liveried equipages of the FitzMaurices,
the Millings, the Redmans, the Binghams, the
Adamses, the Chews, the Carrolls, the Pinckneys,
the Shippens, the Peterses, the Arnolds came
rolling up to the pillared entrance and gay guests
alighted, passed hurriedly to the <i>boudoirs</i> and
came down to greet Dr. and Mrs. Greydon, and
not the least,&mdash;Miss Mollie.</p>

<p>That young lady was in an anxious mood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
She greeted each arrival in a very sweet and
cordial manner, but she cast constant glances
out into the arched hallway to see if Roderick
Barclugh were among the latest arrivals. She
eagerly scanned every face and at last saw him
come with James Wilson, the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mollie watched him ascend the curved staircase
on one side and return with the line of guests
on the other. He was fashionably dressed in his
powdered wig and queue and his shining buckles
and lace frills. No gentlemen present bore a
more distinguished appearance than Roderick
Barclugh. She watched him shake the hand
of her father and her mother, and, when her turn
came, she offered her hand with delight in her
eyes as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad that you remembered my special
invitation.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight flush in her cheeks, and she
knew that Barclugh approved of her gown and
her hair by the satisfied glances that his eyes made.
He looked into her eyes as he said softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great pleasure, to see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh bowed profoundly and
passed among the guests. He was in the midst
of a group who were gossiping about the Arnolds.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; asked
Anne Milling, approaching Barclugh in her most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bewitching manner, &#8220;the court-martial of General
Arnold has found him guilty of misconduct
in his office as Commander of Philadelphia and
General Washington has been ordered to make
a public reprimand. The dear, brave General!
He has been made to endure more than he can
stand. Don&#8217;t you think so, Mr. Barclugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold surely is brave, but has he
not been extravagant?&#8221; was Barclugh&#8217;s reply
in a tone indicating his aversion to the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have little sympathy with him as he has
become very imperious and overbearing of late,
since he married Peggy Shippen. He did not
have the fortune or the position in society to
marry such an ambitious girl as Margaret; she
needed a baronet,&#8221; volunteered Mrs. FitzMaurice,
who had the faculty of speaking her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a question which one has the most ambition,
Mrs. Arnold or the General, since they
have moved into their new country home, &#8216;Mount
Pleasant&#8217; on the Schuylkill. Have you attended
any of their gorgeous entertainments? No
wonder his ambition runs away with him. They
both love luxury and they need money,&#8221; chimed
in Sally Redman, who loved to have people
realize that she knew a few things about the gay
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me whisper something. It must never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
be repeated. The French Minister refused
General Arnold a loan. I have it from very
direct sources,&#8221; volunteered Charles Bingham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he go to the French Minister himself?&#8221;
queried Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Bingham, and the whole group
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! Here they come now,&#8221; whispered
Anne Milling as she gave Mr. Bingham a touch
on his arm.</p>

<p>The General and his wife came up arm in arm,
all smiles when the group just referring to them
turned and greeted the Commander of Philadelphia
and his wife most cordially:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how do you do, General? How do
you do, Peggy, my dear? I am so glad to see
you,&#8221; said Mrs. FitzMaurice in her sweetest
tones and with a smile for both of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold at once addressed herself to
Roderick Barclugh and the General to M. de la
Luzerne, who had just joined the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that we may see you out to &#8216;Mount
Pleasant&#8217; very soon, Mr. Barclugh. My sister,
Bessie, is now visiting me and it would give us
the greatest pleasure to see you. Tuesdays are
our days. Then, I must tell you&#8221;&mdash;in her most
pleasing tones&mdash;&#8220;the General has taken a very
great interest in you of late.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;I thank you, Madam; it will be not your
pleasure alone, but mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>In times of war very little of the drawing-room
satisfied the men of affairs; so, when the ladies
and the macaronis were fairly aglow with gossip
over the tea-cups, John Adams, Dr. Greydon
and Charles Thompson found themselves together
in the doctor&#8217;s office and began to discuss
serious affairs over their pipes and mugs of home
ale.</p>

<p>&#8220;By thunder! That trading house of Milling
and FitzMaurice brought home a fat prize,
William,&#8221; remarked Charles Thompson. &#8220;One
of their privateers secured a British ship worth
eighty thousand pounds sterling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible? No wonder they can live
in luxury. They are growing fat out of the war.
That one prize would pay back one half that they
have loaned to Congress,&#8221; continued John Adams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always was opposed to war on general
principles,&#8221; argued Dr. Greydon, &#8220;but if we
must fight, all right. Yet, when private individuals
can go out on the high seas and take other private
individuals&#8217; substance it seems like licensed
robbery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I venture to say riches thus gained will never
profit the gainer. Robert FitzMaurice has made
fabulous riches out of his piratical enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
but he will lose it all, some day,&#8221; reasoned the
Secretary of Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho there!&#8221; exclaimed John Adams, &#8220;do
you know that FitzMaurice and Milling are now
planning to start a bank and to do all the financing
for Congress? They want a charter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; began Dr. Greydon. &#8220;First,
Congress grants letters of Marque and Reprisal
to these enterprising merchants, in order for
them to hold up their neighbors&#8217; ships and rob
them; now, when they grow rich out of the war,
we will license them to hold our hands when they
can go into <i>our</i> pockets and rob <i>us</i>. Oh! That&#8217;s
a fine scheme to throttle our war. They could
tell us then to lay down our arms if the bank
was not pleased. Never let us get into the clutches
of these financiers. The power of the purse
must always belong to Congress, the representatives
of the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Dr. Greydon, and then Charles
Thompson added:</p>

<p>&#8220;The money of our Congress maybe depreciated,
but if the people of our country accept it, which
the patriots do&mdash;maybe the Tories do not&mdash;we
will prosper; but if we give ourselves into the
hands of the bank, they would take nothing
but specie for payment and we would be paralyzed.
We could do nothing but surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>&#8220;Here! Here! William, we are forgetting
our ladies,&#8221; said John Adams, and they arose
and joined the guests in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Mollie was helping her mother serve the tea;
the guests were seated at the tables; but she
did not lose sight of Barclugh. Although the
large drawing-room and the library were thronged
with guests, she could not let him out of her
sight. Members of Congress, generals, their
sons and daughters, and French diplomats
thronged the rooms but they soon began to depart.</p>

<p>At the first opportunity Barclugh left his tea-cup
and found his way to the side of Mollie.
She turned and said spiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must miss your gay society in Paris,
Mr. Barclugh? They must be so different from
our society? I would be delighted to travel
abroad again; I was so young when papa took
me to England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Society is very much the same the world
over,&#8221; answered Barclugh,&mdash;&#8220;so insincere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are all people insincere, Mr. Barclugh?&#8221;
returned Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means. There is one whom I know
to be sincere.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_034fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Mollie Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, do you really, Mr. Barclugh, enjoy your
sojourn in America?&#8221; insisted Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would leave to-morrow if it were not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the <i>tete-a-tetes</i> that I have with one whom I
meet too seldom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is exasperating, Mr. Barclugh. Who
can it be? Is it Mrs. Arnold?&#8221; sallied Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! no! no! She is too imperious. Can
you not guess?&#8221; and Barclugh looked so appealingly
into Mollie&#8217;s eyes that her pulse seemed
to cease.</p>

<p>She grew pale and could scarcely venture a
reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not dare to guess,&#8221; she said softly,
&#8220;for fear that I might be mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Secretary of Congress, Charles Thompson,
came up to Mollie at this juncture to bid her
good-bye and she was drawn into the duties of
bidding the guests farewell; Roderick Barclugh
left Dorminghurst that afternoon, determined
to win the heart of Mollie Greydon; but little
did he know what stirring events would intervene
before he could offer himself to the one he loved.</p>

CHAPTER IV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;That game,</span> Charles, last night, upset our
plans, and we must recoup our fortunes from
government,&#8221; suggested young Lord Carlisle
bitterly, on the morning after he had lost ten
thousand pounds sterling at a single cast at hazard
in Brooks&#8217; Club.</p>

<p>He was addressing his two cronies, Charles
Fox and George Selwyn. Both were members
of Parliament and included within the inner
Cabinet and Councils of the government of Lord
North. Both were powerful in the set that
obtained favors (for the chosen few) from the
monarch, George III.</p>

<p>In order that no one might observe them, the
three were alighting from the chariot of Lord
Carlisle and entering the &#8220;Old Cock&#8221; Tavern,
a resort for literary drudges and solicitors of
Temple Court. They entered at the side entrance
in Apollo Court, just off Fleet Street. They
had come directly from the gaming-table, dejected
and desperate from heavy loss, to a place where
they could retire securely to one of the cosy
corners for breakfast and repose.</p>

<p>Having been all night in the great room at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Brooks&#8217;, nerved to high tension at the hazard of
great stakes, this sorry set of cronies sought refreshment
and a reckoning of their shattered fortunes.
One of those reposeful havens for the &#8220;weary
and heavy laden,&#8221; in old London&#8217;s jaded life,
now appealed to these gaming spirits and leaders
of government.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Old Cock&#8221; boasted of a respectable antiquity
even at this time, 1777. The old gossip, Samuel
Pepys, had graced its haunts in the time of the
Stuarts; it survived the ravages of the Plague,
and even the great fire of Old London; the entrance
was a passageway that passed a flight of stairs
and a bar into a large, well-lighted coffee-room.
Skylights furnished air and sunshine whenever
London could lay claim to the latter. Bright
sea-sand glistened on the faultless floor. Rows
of mahogany boxes, formed by high-backed seats
on three sides and open toward the center, surrounded
the entire room, except where the huge
fireplace added good cheer in its restful, blazing
wood.</p>

<p>In one of these boxes a party could be quite
secluded. The tops of the settles were higher
than one&#8217;s head and a bandy-legged table of
mahogany sat between the benches. The mantel
of the fireplace was massive oak, carved after
the fashion of the Elizabethan age, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
atmosphere of the place was presided over by
a heroic representation of an &#8220;Old Cock&#8221; perched
high at the farther end in the act of hailing the
morn.</p>

<p>Noted for its wine and for those &#8220;who knew
what was good and could afford to pay for it,&#8221;
the &#8220;Old Cock&#8221; was justly celebrated for the
solace within its walls.</p>

<p>Life swirled in Old London, around the young
bloods at Brooks&#8217;. The great room where hazard
ran riot beheld noted encounters between Fox,
March, Burgoyne, Carlisle, Rodney and Selwyn.
These revels afforded gossip in coffee-houses,
taverns and drawing-rooms. Many a bottle of
good, old port tickled the cockles of a Londoner&#8217;s
heart, while Fox&#8217;s debts, Carlisle&#8217;s losses and
Selwyn&#8217;s witticisms afforded old London-town
an excuse to gossip about people to one&#8217;s heart&#8217;s
content. A reckoning, however, was sure to
come. No bulls and bears were in existence
then, but their progenitors revelled in high play
at the club.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charles,&#8221; began Carlisle in a cozy nook of
the &#8220;Old Cock,&#8221; &#8220;you know that Burgoyne&#8217;s
return from his disaster affects our situation
most seriously. What can be done to meet
our disappointments? If Burgoyne had simply
reached New York, the King would have elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
him to the vacant peerage of S&mdash;&mdash; as was
promised us; and Parliament would have voted
him one hundred thousand pounds sterling so
that he could have paid me his debt of twenty-five
thousand pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fox, who had been in Lord North&#8217;s cabinet,
and as Junior Lord of the Treasury had opposed
the estrangement of the Colonies, foresaw the
disaster in war as carried on by Lord North.
His powerful influences were directed to stop
the war more by diplomacy than by force. But
his gambling proclivities kept all of his friends
in jeopardy. Now something must be done
to stop the disastrous war and at the same stroke
recoup the waning fortunes of himself and his
cronies.</p>

<p>Therefore, turning to his two friends in distress,
he mildly argued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well Carlisle, I shall go to my friend, Mr.
Prince, Governor of the Corporation of the
Bank of England, and ask him to insist with
that old fool, Lord North, that if our soldiers
can not whip the Colonists, we must <i>buy</i> the
leaders. We can appoint a commission with
yourself, Carlisle, at its head to go to America
and settle the conflict with a <i>coup d&#8217;etat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selwyn listened most eagerly to whatever
Charles advised at all times, but now he smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
graciously as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Zounds! that&#8217;s good! My Lord, if you once
get to America to show your bags of gold to the
hungry dogs, the woods will ring with the yelps
of the hungry pack. They would give up the
chase and devour the bones that you might throw
to them,&#8221; exclaimed Selwyn, who sat in the corner
sipping his well-brewed coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a stroke,&#8221; continued Selwyn, lazily,
&#8220;to win the Colonies, would bring us the King&#8217;s
favor and two hundred thousand pounds sterling
by Parliament, my Lord; and we would once
more recoup our fortunes. Then Charles could
satisfy the Shylocks and kick them down the
stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>While these gentlemen of plots on the government
exchequer were scheming in their corner,
the rest of the coffee-room of the old tavern was
humming with groups of customers, who were
drinking, smoking, and eating to their hearts&#8217;
content.</p>

<p>Lingering over tankards of ale, or puffing at
long pipes of tobacco, tables were surrounded
by wise-visaged solicitors discussing the possible
phases of the trial of the Duchess of Kingsley,
who was on trial for bigamy.</p>

<p>Having married, clandestinely, the second son
of Lord Ker, and the marriage being disowned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the Duchess had lived publicly with the Duke
of Kingsley, and finally married him during
Mr. Ker&#8217;s lifetime. But at the death of the Duke,
proceedings were instituted by which she was
found guilty of the crime charged, and thus
lost all the property left her by the Duke. If
such subjects did not afford gossip at the coffee-houses
others did.</p>

<p>In one corner were the literary characters,
among whom was Dr. Johnson, and, of course,
his friend Boswell,&mdash;surrounded by a company
of satellites, all of whom paid court to the old
autocrat, the leader of all criticism, and the
arbiter of all opinions on the passing literary
productions.</p>

<p>Oh, how the &#8220;old growler&#8221; delighted in a
pint of port! When his soul grew mellow how
that charmed circle delighted to hear him repeat
for the five hundredth time those favorite lines
from rare old Ben Jonson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Wine, it is the milk of Venus,</div>
<div class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</div>
<div class="verse">That cheers the brains, makes wit the quicker,</div>
<div class="verse">Pays all debts, cures all diseases,</div>
<div class="verse">And at once three senses pleases.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Selwyn was a great admirer of Fox, and was
one of his life-long friends, but a courtier first
and last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>His friendship for Lord Carlisle also was of
the most tender nature. He stood between
his two friends as the adviser of Carlisle and the
guardian of Fox. The latter was a brilliant politician,
and a passionate gamester, who needed
the good offices of a diplomat like Selwyn.</p>

<p>Yet Selwyn&#8217;s most concern was to keep Fox
within a sphere of usefulness, in order that Fox
could pay back to Carlisle money that was loaned
at the gaming-table. The interests of the
three were so involved that one had to maintain
the other in order to preserve himself; they repeated
the story of Cæsar and Pompey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the scheme,&#8221; ejaculated Selwyn, who
was by this time growing enthusiastic over the
idea of stopping the American War with the
English valor that wins their battles when bayonets
fail. &#8220;I am acquainted with a young man who
is the secret agent of the Bank of England in France
and has brought us the innermost information
from the French Court by reason of his skill
as a diplomat, and his pretended friendship for
the American cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a personal friend of Dr. Franklin.
In America he could be recognized as a supporter
of the cause of independence while he kept your
Commission informed as to the weakness within
the American ranks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;You could induce him,&#8221; continued Selwyn
spiritedly, &#8220;to undertake the mission by promising
the highest position, that of Viceroy in the
Colonies. You could also offer a peerage and
vast landed estates in America for his success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No man could resist such inducements,&#8221;
concluded Carlisle, as he drank in the plans
with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>Fox sat there unconcerned as to details, but
awakening out of a reverie on last night&#8217;s game
remarked to Selwyn:</p>

<p>&#8220;George, I am agreed. You talk well, but
what is the man&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Fox did not have so much
concern about the Colonies, as he did about the
vast sum of money that he owed Carlisle. He
was ready for any expedient to pacify his creditor
and give some excuse to put off demands on his
depleted fortunes.</p>

<p>If Carlisle should succeed in retaining the
Colonies within the empire, and at the same time
receive great personal treasures from the government,
Fox&#8217;s personal obligations would be cancelled
and a disastrous war would be ended.</p>

<p>Selwyn, replying to Fox&#8217;s question, said persuasively:</p>

<p>&#8220;His name, my dear Charles, is Roderick
Barclugh, but for purposes of state it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
withheld until the plans are working. If you are
agreed you can submit your plan to the King
through the bank. I am sure that the King
will take up your ideas as his own. Then he has
to listen to those people that control his purse-strings,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle, young and ambitious to recoup
his severe losses, arose from the breakfast and
said decisively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, the plan is well conceived. If
it fails to subdue the rebels, my name will sink to
the depths of ignominy; but if it succeeds, I shall
have the honor of serving my King as well as
Warren Hastings at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the three plotters departed for
their lodgings, to be ready for the game at Brooks&#8217;
that night.</p>

<p>Selwyn, the diplomat of the trio, set the plans
to working. He interviewed Mr. Prince, the
Governor of the Bank of England, who consented
to influence the King.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Your Majesty,</span> I am informed that the
French monarch has decided to recognize the
independence of the Americans and put all the
resources of France against Great Britain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whence comes your information, Mr. Prince?&#8221;
asked George III, as he sat in his private study
of St. James&#8217;s, October, 1777.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, the secret service of the Bank
of England has kept Roderick Barclugh in the
French Court. He is on terms of intimacy
with Louis XVI. He associates with Benjamin
Franklin and the Colonial party; he keeps us
informed as to every phase of their affairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>George III rubbed his hands in each other
and looked impatient but gracious, yet his eyes
had an anxious gleam as he nervously asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the recognition of the independence of
the Colonies possible and has it come at last?
What shall we do about it then, Mr. Prince?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one way to reconcile the Americans,
since Burgoyne&#8217;s surrender, your Majesty,&#8221;
replied the Bank Governor. &#8220;We must convince
the leaders of the army and the men of substance
in the Colonies, that a long-drawn-out war will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ruin the country&mdash;that the return of peace will
establish commerce and prosperity; and that
allegiance to your Majesty&#8217;s person and crown
will give the protection that a young commonwealth
needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, very well, sir, but what means
are you going to use to convince these rebels?&#8221;
queried the monarch, impatiently, as he began
to comprehend the undertaking that began to
develop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by warlike means, your Majesty, which
has cost your exchequer twenty thousand pounds
sterling for each and every rebel so far killed,
but by the most subtle subjection&mdash;that of diplomacy
and finance,&#8221; replied Mr. Prince (who
knew that the King had used this policy to carry
his desires through Parliament).</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is good,&#8221; exclaimed the King. &#8220;But
whom can we trust with such a delicate mission?
I have learned to depend upon the wisdom of
your money, but not upon persons. Can you
lay a plan that will accomplish the result? I
have so few men of the genius that you display,
Mr. Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Prince now had the ear of the monarch,
and as George III showed his abject helplessness,
the holder of England&#8217;s purse-strings took advantage
of the situation to carry out the plot planned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the &#8220;Old Cock&#8221; Tavern:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Majesty, we must send a Commission
to treat with the Colonists on the spot, when we
have turned the men of substance to a desire
for peace. We must send a skilled diplomat
among the Colonists, who will keep us informed
as to what the Colonists will do for peace if we
were to grant all their demands except independence.
This undertaking will be dangerous and
delicate. Our agent must gain the confidence
of the leaders within the rebel lines. He must
be one who can go without the least suspicion.
If he succeeds we must reward him by making
him Viceroy (an echo of the conspirators in the &#8216;Old
Cock&#8217; Tavern) and by granting him a peerage
and a landed estate befitting his dignity of office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed, Mr. Prince, but whom can you
recommend for such delicate commissions?&#8221;
asked the King, as he grew enthusiastic over
the plot, for George III loved intrigue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed &#8220;the arbiter of the power
of the purse&#8221; (the one great security of the rights
of Englishmen), as he bowed very low to the
monarch:</p>

<p>&#8220;May it please your Majesty to entrust your
humble servant with so much privilege as to name
the one who is to save your Colonies. There
is no one that will respect your royal will with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as much diligence as your faithful diplomat,
Roderick Barclugh. Then for the commissioner
to conclude your terms of peace, I would humbly
beg that you entrust such matters of importance
to your Lord Carlisle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent! Excellent! Sir,&#8221; exclaimed the
King, &#8220;but where are these gentlemen? Command
them into my presence. My plans shall
be carried out at once. All that was needed
was to have a suggestion, for these have always
been my ideas, I now stand firmly on this idea
since you have seconded me; I have always stood
for it; England shall not lose her Colonies. I
am not to be outdone by the French. Where are
these gentlemen, sir?&#8221; asked the subtle monarch
of the President of the Bank of England.</p>

<p>Mr. Prince bowed and left the King, for he
knew his character so well that there was nothing
more for him to do. He had carried his plans,
although His Majesty had finally claimed them
as his own.</p>

<p>However, when the King asked for Roderick
Barclugh and Lord Carlisle, these worthy gentlemen
were close at hand (not by accident) but
by means of the finesse of the worthy George
Selwyn, who was a courtier of no mean order.
He had his pawns ready for the next move on
the checker-board.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>The King had now grown more self-conceited,
and when these worthy gentlemen came into
his private audience and both approached and
knelt in obeisance to his commands (for Mr.
Prince had given the cue of what was to happen
when he passed out), the King arose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Carlisle, arise. Mr. Barclugh, arise.
It is at your Sovereign&#8217;s commands that you
shall proceed to the shores of his rebellious Colonists
and use your persuasion to insure their allegiance
to the British Realm. Gentlemen, no means
must be spared to preserve the integrity of the
British Empire. May the blessings of God
pursue your endeavors. Follow the plans that
hath pleased the Almighty to have your Sovereign
prepare.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this inspired speech,
His Majesty stepped toward Lord Carlisle and
Mr. Barclugh, and shook each by the hand
and spoke of the great pleasure that his duty
gave, whereupon these two representatives of
royalty retired in due form and respect from his
royal presence.</p>

<p>When our commissioner and our secret agent
emerged from the august presence of George III,
they made straightway to the chariot of Lord
Carlisle and were driven post-haste to Brooks&#8217;
Club. Carlisle alighted, but Barclugh went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the house of his chief, Mr. Prince, for he was
in London incognito.</p>

<p>Fox at the head of the faro table was banker,
and Selwyn sat opposite, in the great green room
at Brooks&#8217;. The play was highly interesting
when Carlisle entered the room. The Bank
was two thousand pounds sterling to the good
and the night was but begun. Lord Carlisle
went to the side of Fox and spoke to him, who
turned the deal over to Gilly Williams. Selwyn
arose at a sign from Fox, and the three conspirators
left for a private room to discuss the new
phase of American politics.</p>

<p>Fox, who was easily the leader of the Whig
coterie that centered in Brooks&#8217; Club, opened
the discussion by remarking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the &#8216;lunatic&#8217; (George III) carried out
the plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has,&#8221; replied Carlisle, who had just left
his Majesty.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is this Barclugh? Can we depend
upon him? His task is almost superhuman,&#8221;
commented Fox to his cronies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barclugh is the grandson of Sir George
Barclugh of the plot to murder William of Orange,&#8221;
remarked Carlisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will do, then,&#8221; assented Fox. &#8220;For
the followers of the Stuarts were the most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
zealots of any age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Barclugh has been the secret agent
of Mr. Prince, the President of the Bank of
England, at the court of Louis for five years
past. His reports have been reliable and I can
vouch for anything that he undertakes,&#8221; contended
Selwyn, who was the balance-wheel and
the diplomat of these choice spirits of Brooks&#8217;
high play.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, very well,&#8221; exclaimed Charles,
&#8220;you and Carlisle fix up the details; I must be
back, Gilly will ruin me. You and Carlisle
fix up these matters&mdash;whatever you do will suit
me. You know I must not leave the game,&#8221;
contended Fox, as he nervously spoke and returned
to the green room and hurried to his seat at the
head of the table where the banker sat turning
the cards for the coterie of gamesters.</p>

<p>Selwyn now had an opportunity to go calmly
over the points at issue with Carlisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;This war must be ended, my Lord,&#8221; said
Selwyn. &#8220;Give Barclugh every opportunity to
win the leaders. Keep the army, under that
drawing-room general, Sir Henry, at a respectful
distance from the wily Washington; let Barclugh
ply his arts among the substantial Colonists,
and you will return as the savior of the Colonies
and a Parliamentary grant will await you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;But suppose the plans fail, George, what
then?&#8221; anxiously queried Carlisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing fails that Britons put their hands
and hearts to,&#8221; expostulated Selwyn. &#8220;Start
to-morrow; be on the scene&mdash;Barclugh will follow.
Nothing daunts the ambitious Briton; we must
succeed, or ruin stares us in the face. The
continuous drain upon our resources at the gaming-table
has sapped our substance,&mdash;we must
have funds from government or give up our life
at the Club. Carlisle, the game depends upon
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus reasoned Selwyn, for he knew that the
select few who practised high play at Brooks&#8217;
had exhausted the resources of their set, and
the only legitimate prey at hand was the funds
of government to be won at the game of Colonial
politics.</p>

<p>Carlisle left on the first ship for New York,
and Barclugh was to leave as soon as Lord Germaine
could fix up the funds and credentials
for him to carry to the scene of war in America.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was fitted by environment
and education to become a diplomat of no mean
order. Born in 1749, his parentage a Scotch
father and a French mother&mdash;the rare combination
of shrewdness and finesse&mdash;whose traditions
on one side led back to the cause of the Stuarts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and a line of court favorites of the French monarch
on the other&mdash;distinguished him for a life of bold
intrigue.</p>

<p>His grandfather, Sir George Barclugh, quit
his native land with the Pretender, James II.
His father was reared in Paris, and married the
French Queen&#8217;s lady-in-waiting, Marie La Fitte.
The union was happy and two sons were the issue.
The older was named George Barclugh and the
younger Roderick. The boys grew up surrounded
by all the elegant manners of the French Court
at this period.</p>

<p>At twenty-two years of age Roderick Barclugh
could speak English, French and Spanish. He
was tall and vigorous in constitution; endowed
with shrewd, steely-blue eyes and a prominent
aquiline nose. Firmness and fortitude were in
every expression of his eyes and mouth. His
hair was reddish-brown in color&mdash;partaking
of the auburn locks of his Scotch grandfather,
and the black of his mother&#8217;s race.</p>

<p>He was faultless in his easy manner when
in society of ladies, and when among men inclined
to be brusque and haughty. His eyes had a
merry assurance of good will; yet therein could
be found firmness, determination and passion.
His voice was trained for the dulcet tones of
persuasion, and, at will, he could command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the robust tones of his father&#8217;s race.</p>

<p>Without effort Roderick Barclugh could control
his feelings and be nonchalant to sentiment,
and on necessary occasions be frivolous and gay.
His composition had all the artful diplomacy
of a French courtier and the canny ways of an
ingenious and bold Scotsman&mdash;altogether, a brilliant
and dangerous being.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Revolutionary</span> New York was enveloped
in an atmosphere of sombre unrest. The English
had driven out the patriot families; some loyalists,
however, who were persecuted in other colonies
sought refuge in New York, but they simply
became hangers-on at a huge military camp.</p>

<p>Gayety was forced. The monotony of military
cares bore heavily upon the British leaders and
at length desperation was traced upon their
faces. There was no enterprise. Something
must be done or the spirit of militarism would die.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton, the Commander-in-Chief,
was fat and short. Punctilious with his officers,
formal,&mdash;even distant, in his manners&mdash;he was
not one to inspire enthusiasm. His face was
full, his nose was large and prominent, and
although an expression of animated intelligence
at times pervaded his countenance, still he
lacked the rare ability to inspire confidence and
conviction. He was simply in command because
favoritism had placed him there; he was a drawing-room
general.</p>

<p>On a crisp day in November, General Clinton
and Lord Carlisle were surveying the landscape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from the drawing-room of the Beekman mansion,
which was a beautiful seat of revolutionary times,
and the chosen country residence of the British
Commander.</p>

<p>The blue waters of the bay were whipped into
white waves as the nor&#8217;east gale swept over the
water. The energy of the wind broke forth
in sparkling waves upon the bosom of the harbor
and Sir Henry explained to Lord Carlisle how
the commerce of the new continent would center
in this haven that was now controlled by his
British forces. He gestured confidently as he
maintained that the admiralty had a base in
New York harbor from which to fit out its men-of-war
and carry on the conflict in any direction.</p>

<p>In the midst of his laborious arguments Sir
Henry exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord, there comes one of our forty-four-gun
frigates! Zounds! She&#8217;s standing right up
to the inner anchorage. She may be a messenger
from our War Lord, Germaine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Henry took up his spying-glass and stepped
out upon the portico to see what ship it might be.</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle walked back and forth impatiently,
while Sir Henry closely watched the movements
of the ship.</p>

<p>These two men differed in their plans for the
conduct of the war. Lord Carlisle wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
offer a proclamation to the Colonists, openly
conceding everything that the people demanded
except absolute independence. But Sir Henry
chafed under this means of procedure. He saw
that such a course implied the failure of the
military to deal with the problem of subduing
the Americans. He contended that a decisive
stroke must be made by the army before any
terms should be offered the rebellious Colonists.</p>

<p>Carlisle spoke impatiently when the ship was
looming up in full view:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that Germaine has sent Barclugh with
definite instructions as to our course. We are
losing valuable time and opportunity here by reason
of our inactivity.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last word was a distinct challenge to Clinton,
who lowered his glass long enough to look
squarely at Carlisle and remark spiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use to waste words, my Lord.
We cannot afford to sacrifice the reputation of
English arms; it would be suicidal. Treat with
the rascals? Yes, when they have felt the force
of our power. Now that they have formed an
alliance with our ancient enemy we must deal
them a crushing blow, first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlisle, however, was insisting upon the right
of the commissioners to dictate the policy, yet
he did not care how the results were attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
so long as his mission to America was successful.
Fox and Selwyn would see that he was properly
rewarded, provided the Colonies were not lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Sir Henry,&#8221; retorted Carlisle,
when the General stood before him in an attitude
of defiance, &#8220;but the longer that we wait, the
farther apart we drift. I am intent upon activities
in one way or another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There she comes to,&#8221; continued Sir Henry,
as he resumed his spying investigations. &#8220;By
the speed that she comes up the bay, I believe
that she may be the Prince Harry, the fastest
cruiser of the Admiralty&#8217;s register.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How deluded these rebels are to hold out against
such odds on the sea,&#8221; exclaimed Sir Henry,
with animation. &#8220;How magnificent to behold
the seamanship of our sailors! Behold them
swarm the yard-arms! There go the anchors
to the catheads! She swings to the cable! Her
sails are stowed in a twinkling! What discipline!
I maintain our sovereignty of the seas and we have
no business to beg a settlement except at our own
terms,&#8221; concluded General Clinton as he turned
upon Lord Carlisle, waving his little fat hands
and arms majestically.</p>

<p>Carlisle saw where Sir Henry had placed him
when he appealed to an Englishman&#8217;s vanity,
his ships; but he looked at General Clinton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
through those blue eyes for an instant and fell
back upon the only argument that an Englishman
could never withstand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Sir Henry, you do not comprehend,&#8221;
argued Carlisle, &#8220;what an expenditure of treasure
this war has already cost the King&#8217;s exchequer.
Mr. Prince, the Governor of the Bank of England,
says: &#8216;We shall all be paupers by this everlasting
drain on our gold.&#8217; Sir Henry, I represent
the financial side of this problem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my Lord,&#8221; retorted Sir Henry, &#8220;all
that I can say to your argument is, that with
your money power, as now constituted, having
your Bank Governor at the throat of our nation,
you will make cowards of us all. We shall lose
the toil of two centuries and the sacrifices of
twenty generations of Englishmen in colonizing
a wilderness. For what? For the dross called
pounds sterling! The Colonists are unruly children.
Chastise them and then bring them back
home and treat them generously.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carlisle now paced nervously up and down
the portico, evidently thinking of how he would
turn the last argument of Sir Henry, when the
little fat body of the General fairly bubbled over
with pugnacity as he grew red in the face and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the War Lord would give me the men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
chastise the rebels well, and not listen to the
whining Bank Governor, we could wage a successful
campaign and make an honorable peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle held his peace and glared at
Clinton.</p>

<p>Now General Clinton turned toward the bay
and there beheld events transpiring that turned
the temper of his conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zounds!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They have lowered
a boat and are making for the Battery.
There must be despatches or important personages
aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his glass and looked upon the boat&#8217;s
crew approaching the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not bother ourselves,&#8221; contended
Sir Henry, &#8220;Andre will forward anything of
importance to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two representatives of government then
returned to the drawing-room to get out of the
biting wind and to indulge in a bottle of Madeira
for old England&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>At the office of the Commander-in-Chief,
No. 1 Broadway, was Major John Andre
who had come from the capture of Charleston
with General Clinton as Adjutant General of
the English Army. He was unmarried and
young and affable. His lodgings were in the
same house as the General&#8217;s office and he dined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
at the King&#8217;s Arms Tavern, No. 9 Broadway,
a few doors from his quarters.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat could land from the Prince
Harry, no time was lost in forwarding the despatches
to headquarters.</p>

<p>A passenger came ashore, a young man dressed
in the style of a Parisian of fashion. He had
travelled under an assumed name, for even
the British naval officers were not to know his
mission. The arrangement of his queue was
faultless. His satins and sword, his laces and
high-heeled shoes, indicated the courtier. But
Pierre La Fitte was none other than Roderick
Barclugh on his mission for the King of England.</p>

<p>When Major Andre appeared in the ante-room
of the headquarters of General Clinton,
he extended his hand to this strange gentleman
cordially and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that I have the honor of addressing
M. Pierre La Fitte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I am called,&#8221; replied the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; continued Andre. &#8220;I will
take you to my quarters as I understand that you
are on a secret mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Major Andre had received the despatches
there was one in cipher marked &#8220;important&#8221;
and it read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Whitehall, Sept. 25, 177&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir: I have the honor to send on a particular
secret Mission to America, our esteemed Friend,
M. Pierre La Fitte.</p>

<p>&#8220;He accompanies this despatch and his Identity
must be kept a profound Secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Provide him with secret and suitable Quarters
and put him in communication with General
Clinton and Lord Carlisle at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Geo. Germaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adj&#8217;t. Gen. John Andre.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>As soon as Major Andre had conducted M.
La Fitte to sleeping apartments adjoining his
own, and had made the stranger welcome, he
sent a courier with despatches and information
to the Beekman House that M. La Fitte would
be accompanied by himself to meet Lord Carlisle
and the General.</p>

<p>La Fitte rested until nightfall when darkness
would conceal his movements.</p>

<p>A post-chaise drew up in front of the headquarters
and two gentlemen disguised in great-coats
emerged from the building and made their
way to the carriage.</p>

<p>The three miles to the Beekman House were
quickly covered and the secret agent alighted
with Major Andre. The two approached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mansion and a sentry challenged them, but
the Adjutant was recognized and allowed to
enter. A liveried footman announced the two
to the General who greeted them eagerly in the
reception room.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are gratified to have you with us, Mr.
Barclugh, and we believe that the nature of your
mission will not let you remain in our midst
very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear you address me by my
own name, General Clinton,&#8221; responded Barclugh.
&#8220;My voyage has been tedious, indeed, under
my assumed name of M. La Fitte.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sealed instructions on Barclugh&#8217;s mission
had been forwarded by Major Andre to the
Beekman House and they were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Whitehall, 24 Sept, 177&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir: I have the great Pleasure of conveying
the King&#8217;s Commands, by introducing to you Mr.
Roderick Barclugh who is commissioned to act
as the Special Secret Agent of His Majesty to
the Men of Substance among his Rebellious
Colonists.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Duration of the Rebellion is considered,
it has been mortifying to his Majesty
to have no decisive Blow inflicted to speedily
suppress the rebels; and His Majesty commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
me to instruct that your Assistance to the Diplomacy
of Mr. Barclugh and Lord Carlisle would
be most gratifying to His Royal Pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great Pleasure to me to have another
Occasion of obeying the King&#8217;s Commands
by desiring you to convey to Lord Carlisle, His
Majesty&#8217;s approbation of His Lordship&#8217;s mission
to America.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Geo. Germaine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Henry Clinton, K. B.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Carlisle was much flattered by the
receipt of the King&#8217;s encouragement, although
Clinton noted in the letter a slight expression
of unrest over the lack of results in the war.</p>

<p>However, Clinton did not take all of the burden
of blame on himself; Lords Howe and Cornwallis
had made some of the mistakes in the Jersey
Campaigns and he was willing for the diplomatists
to take a hand at the subjugation of the rebels,
for a while, at least. They had talked much,
as usual; now let them try their skill at results.</p>

<p>Sir Henry had to give some instructions to
his Adjutant, so he turned to Roderick Barclugh
as he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me for a few moments, Mr. Barclugh.
I have some urgent matters to dispose of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; returned Barclugh as he took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a discussion of affairs with Lord Carlisle, asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the situation here, my Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s hard to convince these military people,&#8221;
answered Carlisle as he pointed his thumb over
his shoulder in the direction of General Clinton
and Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume so,&#8221; assented Barclugh, dryly,
as he shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;But what have
you done, my Lord, on <i>your</i> mission?&#8221; asked
Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing but to wait for you,&#8221; answered
Carlisle disgustedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we must do something very soon, or
know the cause,&#8221; declared Barclugh as General
Clinton approached them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; remarked General Clinton, &#8220;we
might better retire to the Council Chamber and
discuss our matters there. Shall I send for Mr.
Eden, my Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind Eden, General,&#8221; replied Carlisle.
&#8220;Mr. Barclugh is anxious to conclude with us
and be about his own mission. I know that
he is impatient at least to be out of New York,&#8221;
replied Carlisle bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, very well, gentlemen,&#8221; assented
Clinton as he led the way to the staircase and
bowed to the other two in Pickwickian fashion
as he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&#8220;After you,&#8221; and he bowed and gestured
toward the staircase with his chubby hand.</p>

<p>A bright fire crackled in the fireplace of a nearly
square room where the diplomats were to hold
council with the Commander-in-Chief; a round
table in the center contained a large map of the
Colonies; a half dozen straight-backed bandy-legged
chairs stood around carelessly; and a
corner closet with a glass door was well stocked
with a choice selection of Madeira.</p>

<p>Here were three representatives of English
authority presented with the problem of subduing
the rebellious Colonies. Each one, however, had
his own pet theory of serving the King, ostensibly
for the glory of the King, but primarily to gain
glory for himself.</p>

<p>Clinton could see no means of ending the war
except by military subjugation; Carlisle was
entirely for conciliation and Barclugh was bent
on subornation. All of these theories were
launched upon the Colonists at the same time
by the subtle minds of George III and his advisers.</p>

<p>Barclugh was impatient to begin the discussion,
so he pulled his chair up to the table and began
to tell his story unceremoniously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, my mission is to create a diversion
among the men of substance in the Colonies,
and I shall do it on a commercial basis. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the military can do its part and pound the army
of Mr. Washington into a defensive position
and at the same time subjugate the southern
Colonies as is planned by the War Lord, I will
overcome the men of substance by means of
finance and commerce. Their commercial instincts
will overshadow the phantom of independence.
The merchants will desire peace and
the old order of stable money and settled commerce.
They cannot resist the consideration of self-interests.
Then Lord Carlisle and his commissioners
can proclaim that the Colonists may have
all of the political freedom and the representation
that they desire, as long as they keep up their
allegiance to the throne of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;But above all where the Colonists will fail,&#8221;
concluded Barclugh, &#8220;will be in their lack of
gold. When the gold of England is put in the
balance, the men of substance will see the hopelessness
of their cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, Mr. Barclugh!&#8221; exclaimed
Lord Carlisle. &#8220;We can grant them a few
titles of nobility also which they will not be able
to resist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But gentlemen,&#8221; added Clinton, &#8220;the military
could put the forces of Mr. Washington on the
defensive at once if we could only take that
stronghold of West Point. That is our stumbling-block.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Our ships could control the Hudson
and cut New England off from the rest, if we could
ascend above West Point. There lies the key
to the military situation. West Point is the
Gibraltar of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; continued Clinton, &#8220;how do you propose
to reach Philadelphia, Mr. Barclugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan is, General Clinton,&#8221; replied Barclugh,
&#8220;to embark here, on one of your ships
which will take me to the east shore of the Chesapeake
Bay and land me in the night. I shall
make my way by land through Delaware to
Wilmington, thence to Philadelphia. My story
shall be that I was landed by a French privateer
that was cruising in these waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well laid, sir!&#8221; exclaimed General
Clinton, rubbing his hands. &#8220;I have the very
ship, the Vulture, Captain Sutherland, that can
take you on board at once and proceed on the
mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I can conceive of nothing but
success in the plans of Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; said
Lord Carlisle, &#8220;and I propose that we drink
to his success.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three plotters stood around the table
and General Clinton filled each one&#8217;s glass from
the buffet with his rarest Madeira, then raising
his glass, the Commander of His Majesty&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
forces in America, proposed a toast, which was
drunk in silence:</p>

</div></div>

<p>After a few civilities exchanged by the King&#8217;s
representatives, Roderick Barclugh was conducted
aboard the sloop-of-war, Vulture, which was commanded
to sail for the Capes of the Chesapeake
and land its passenger at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span> was in a curious state of unpatriotic
sentiment during the winter of 1778.
The merchants, the Quakers and wealthy landowners
(whose fortunes were established) had
sentiments that were decidedly pro-English. Only
the leadership and influence of such men as
Franklin, Mifflin, Thomson and the influx of
patriotism from other Colonies through such men
as Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Jefferson,
Livingston, and the peerless actions of Washington
alone saved the least spark of independence
among the leading citizens. Philadelphia reeked
with Loyalists. After the evacuation of the
town by the British army, it was impossible
for the Whigs to celebrate such a glorious event
by an exclusively Whig ball. All the belles
of the town embraced a list of those who had
attended every social function of the British
officers. They dined where the King was toasted;
attended theatricals where our native land was
ridiculed. Even the glorious heraldic pageant of
the Meschianza claimed homage, from the belles
of the leading families.</p>

<p>The meekness of the Quakers and their horrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of war (upon religious principle) were changed
to loud acclamations of joy when the British
occupied their town. Quakers shook their heads
and looked religiously solemn whenever the
patriots asked for money and provisions; but
when the British presented their demands for
supplies, the Philadelphia Quakers smiled graciously
and gave without stint. The actions of
many of these good people were very questionable
during the trying times of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of Toryism Roderick
Barclugh arrived from New York. Besides the
secret instructions of the Governor of the Bank
of England and the King&#8217;s Minister of War,
Lord George Germaine, Barclugh brought with
him a passport into the confidence of the leading
patriots. The British secret agent had secured
a letter of introduction to Charles Thomson,
Secretary of Congress, from Benjamin Franklin.
The French monarch had secured these credentials
for Barclugh on account of the former
fidelity of his family to the Pretender.</p>

<p>The letter was addressed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Paris, Nov. 20, 1777.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Sir:</p>

<p>&#8220;With much personal satisfaction, the interests
and influence of our friend M. Roderick Barclugh
have been enlisted in our cause. He comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to us with the best of credentials of the French
Monarch. He will represent the interests of
some of France&#8217;s leading men of wealth, and
is desirous of securing Letters of Marque and
Reprisal from our Congress for the purpose of
engaging in privateering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cordial co-operation in his affairs is
solicited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, sir, with sentiments of unabated
esteem,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Your most obedient servant,<br />
&#8220;B. Franklin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Charles Thomson,<br />
<span class="gap">&#8220;Secretary of Congress,</span><br />
<span class="gap2">&#8220;Philadelphia, Pa.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus protected with the best passport obtainable,
a representative of the Bank of England
and of the War Lord took up his abode in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was at once introduced
to the leading firm of traders and privateersmen,
Milling &amp; FitzMaurice. They received him
very cordially, especially when he asked them
if they would honor his drafts on account of his
Bills of Exchange on the Bank of Amsterdam
for twenty thousand pounds sterling. The senior
member of this firm, Mr. Thomas Milling, was very
gracious at once. He invited Roderick Barclugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to make any convenience out of his compting-rooms,
at least, until such times as he could
settle himself in his own quarters.</p>

<p>In 1777 Philadelphia contained about thirty
thousand souls. Front Street, which ran parallel
with the Delaware River, and Market Street, which
ran at right angles to the river, were the principal
thoroughfares for both business and residence.
The merchants, traders, lawyers and doctors
were principally to be found on Front Street
and a few on Market Street. There were no
banks in Philadelphia at that time. All the
merchants had strong boxes of their own.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh engaged a house on Front
Street near Market Street, one of those commodious
Colonial houses used by traders at that time
for both business and lodging purposes. The
room on the first floor fronting on the street
was used as an office for general business; and
immediately in the rear of this room was the
private office of Roderick Barclugh, wherein
all the infamy of commercialism that &#8220;excludes
alike the virtues and the prejudices that stand
in the way of its interest,&#8221; held sway.</p>

<p>The second story of this building contained
the sleeping apartments of the British agent.
He had a clerk for his compting-room and a
man-servant to be general lackey. He maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
no household as his meals were served
him in a private dining-room at the Boar&#8217;s Head
Tavern, next door. All of his affairs were maintained
in great privacy. Therefore, the clerk
and servant performed their daily services and
lived apart from their master.</p>

<p>Thus situated, business began to open up
for Roderick Barclugh, Financier. Characters
through whom negotiations were to be developed
were not lacking. Philadelphia society rankled
with Toryism that threw itself into the dust
at any pretext for aristocratic government. Even
some of the leaders in the Whig party of the town
openly supported Congress because it was to
their interest, but privately could see no good in
the advanced theories of democracy as upheld
by Samuel Adams.</p>

<p>The merchant princes who had privateers
scouring the seas for booty had reason for the
war to continue and give them license to prey
on commerce, but when order should be re-established,
wished an aristocratic government
for the enjoyment of their gains.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was soon a high favorite
among the merchants. Robert FitzMaurice was
the Financier General of Congress, and his
commercial house of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice
was being enriched in every possible channel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The credit that this public position gave him,
advanced his gains in trade and privateering.
His credit allowed him to build ships. Nearly
every week a privateer of his commission was
bringing in a richly-laden merchantman as a
prize to his wharves in the Delaware. These
cargoes enriched Milling &amp; FitzMaurice to the
amount of 800,000 pounds sterling while the
war lasted. Is it any wonder that this firm
should make loans to the Continental Congress
since they were merely putting capital into their
stock in trade?</p>

<p>One man at this time standing in the light
of public opinion as the antithesis of Thomas
Paine in his philosophy of <i>Common Sense</i>, was
James Wilson, a leading lawyer of Philadelphia,
and a writer of no mean abilities. He was the
intimate friend of Robert FitzMaurice, and an
adviser in the aristocratic plans of the financier.
Whatever were the plans of the men of substance
for monarchial forms in government, this clever
lawyer was ever ready to advocate these principles
by means of pamphlets and after-dinner speeches.
He was making a fortune in the practice of law
when the country was in the very throes of despair,
but this Scotchman knew wherein his fat fees lay.</p>

<p>But Roderick Barclugh did not confine his
attention to the merchants and lawyers alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in pursuing his plans. One of the channels
through which he pursued the objects of his mission
was a fishmonger of the town,&mdash;Sven Svenson.</p>

<p>In a raging snowstorm of the winter of 1772,
a small Norwegian bark was making its course
to the Swedish settlements of the Delaware,
with a company of Swedish emigrants. The
ship met an undeserved fate on the sands of the
Jersey Coast. The whole ship&#8217;s company perished
in the frigid blasts of a northeast gale in January,
save one,&mdash;Sven Svenson, a young and vigorous
Swede, eighteen years of age. He was found
numb, and almost exhausted, by a party of Jersey
fishermen. They cared for him and took him
to their homes.</p>

<p>These fishermen plied in the oyster trade of
Philadelphia with the oysters at that time found
in the estuaries of the mouth of the Delaware
River. Two trips a week with a sloop were made
from Philadelphia to the oyster beds and back.
In this trade, Sven at once turned his hand.
He was a handy sailor-man,&mdash;industrious and
saving.</p>

<p>At the time when Roderick Barclugh arrived
in Philadelphia, one of the best known and
happiest men in the town was Sven Svenson.
He had taken hold of the responsible end of
the oyster trade himself. Any day, in oyster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
season, one could find this flaxen-haired Swede
pushing a wheel-barrow up and down Market
Street and through Front Street,&mdash;opening a
dozen here and a dozen there for passers-by.
Everybody ate them on the half-shell, tempered
with a squirt of pepper-&#8220;sass&#8221; from a three-cornered
bottle having a goosequill through the cork.
Every one liked Sven; not alone for the happy
smile with which he opened you an oyster; but
he gave it with a sly wink and an extra squirt of
&#8220;sass,&#8221; that pleased.</p>

<p>The mistresses of the best households held
Sven as a prime favorite, since, whenever they
gave an order for a feast, they could depend
upon having their orders filled. He also supplied
their tastes with the best in the market.</p>

<p>There were no family secrets but Sven heard
them through the servants, or else he happened
upon those little wordy duels which occur in
the best of families. Moreover, as many Swedish
girls were in domestic service it was an easy
matter for Sven to hear all the choice gossip of
the town.</p>

<p>After settling himself into his bachelor quarters,
one of the first things that Roderick Barclugh
undertook was to take early morning walks
all over the town for knowledge of the people.
On several of these observation journeys, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
passed this pumpkin-faced Swede, who, on
general principles, saluted every person of note
with a most gracious courtesy and removal of
his hat.</p>

<p>Barclugh, noticing how good-naturedly everybody
stopped Sven&#8217;s wheel-barrow, and how
many patronized his fresh oysters, recognized
in this guileless vender of shellfish a master-key
to all the town&#8217;s frailties. Following up his
observations, the next day when he met Sven
on his morning rounds,&mdash;merrily pushing his
wheel-barrow up Market Street, dressed in leather
breeches, white cap and apron,&mdash;the fishmonger
stopped and bowed low, half recognizing Barclugh&#8217;s
desire to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you sell your wares, my good man?&#8221;
spoke Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sax pence ahl vat you eet, sahr,&#8221; was the
prompt reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, let us have some of the smallest,
with no pepper-sauce, my man. I like them
briny. Are these from the deep salt water?&#8221;
continued Barclugh, thus to draw out Sven,
who bustled around to please his new customer.</p>

<p>With a jerky motion he opened a choice bivalve
and held it up for Barclugh to eat on the half-shell.</p>

<p>A roguish twinkle gleamed in his eye when
his customer had taken the oyster with a smack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of his lips. Sven held out the other half of the
shell and with his oyster knife pointing to the
fine purplish coloring of the inside, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Das wass a he-oeystar, and ahl maan got
some by me. Van maan eet plaanty he-oeystar
and papper-saass he feel strang ahl daay. Das
wass samting vat halps fadder and strangtans
modder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Swede could have gone on about his
oysters at any length as long as his customer
would eat, but getting enough &#8220;he-oysters,&#8221; Barclugh
handed him a sixpence and at the same
time slipping a crown piece into his hand, asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know General Arnold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah,&#8221; replied Sven, who looked startled and
astonished as he grasped the coin, and squared
himself up to tell <i>all</i> that he knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf baan in dis kontry sax yahr and sax
monts. My name is Sven Svenson, and my
brodder&#8217;s garl varks for Mrs. Arnold. Ganral
Arnold eats plaanty he-oeystar and owes me
tan pound starling. Mrs. Arnold haf a strang
tongue and talks to the Ganral to yump his
yob and vark for dee Angleesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh smiled and left Sven still eager to
tell more, showing unconcern by hastily departing,
yet when walking briskly along he thought to
himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8220;The Swede loves money and his knowledge
must be mine. Arnold can not long resist his
wife and my offers too.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the dinner party at the FitzMaurice&#8217;s,
the next morning was ominous with sullen clouds
in the Arnold homestead. The servants were
gliding from room to room in sober mien; conversations
were carried on in whispers. The
Madam was served with breakfast in her room,
and the General had no appetite. The office
of the Commandant of Philadelphia was streaked
with strata of dark blue vitriolic language.</p>

<p>The first caller was Sven Svenson, who approached
the sentinel before the General&#8217;s office
door. The two fell into conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haf Ganral Arnold been up?&#8221; asked Sven
as he came near the sentinel, with his hat in
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon not, Sven, he was mighty weak-kneed
when he came home last night,&#8221; was
the sentinel&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Das varking maan haf to vark and vark
for hees pay, and de Ganral eets and dreenks
ahl day ant ahl night. Hee talks so hard at
mee I haf to valk oudt ant svore I vas beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much does the General owe you now,
Sven?&#8221; asked the sentinel in an undertone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;Tan pound starling for goot oeystar vat
Mistrees Arnold vants for hair beeg koumpanee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! Sven, you are in luck it&#8217;s not more,&#8221;
blurted out the honest-faced Virginian who
was standing guard at the Commandant&#8217;s office.
&#8220;This Connecticut apothecary and horse-trader
has succeeded to a position where he can gratify
his desires for extravagant living, but if he keeps
on in his present course, he will ruin our cause;
but he has a spouse who leads him a good race,
Sven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yah, Mistrees Arnold vent to ahl dee baals
and deenirs vid Major Andre and dee Angleesh
offeecirs as vas here een Pheeladalpheeia laast

<p>&#8220;Hush, hush, Sven, here comes the General,&#8221;
whispered the sentinel, as he came to attention
and saluted General Arnold who passed to
his small office building next his residence.</p>

<p>Arnold did not look at Sven, but a scowl came
over his brow as he passed into the little office
room, slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>Sven then approached the door very cautiously
and rapped. An imperious voice inside roared:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first greeting Sven got was:</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil you want here? Haven&#8217;t
I told you not to come around here and bother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
me? I haven&#8217;t any money. So that settles it.
Get right out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Ganral Arnold, I need some maaney
to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money, money,&#8221; roared the Commander as
he arose from his seat and paced up and down
the floor, never heeding the Swede. &#8220;Money!
It is the nightmare of my life. I went to that
dinner to drown the thoughts of the cursed stuff,
but the only thing said by the nabobs was to get
it, and the need of it comes upon me at arising.
By thunder! I shall get it! I was never born
to bear these pangs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sven,&#8221; turning to the Swede, &#8220;go and tell
Johnson, in the kitchen, to bring me a hot rum
and have one yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahl right, Ganral,&#8221; replied Sven, as he rubbed
his hands gleefully, and made his retreat, glad
to have a whole skin left.</p>

<p>The next caller was Captain Samuel Risk,
of the Privateer Holker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, General. I&#8217;ve just come
in with the snuggest kind of a prize,&mdash;a West
Indian brig loaded out for home with sugar,
rum and coffee for London merchants. She
will net the firm of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice
ten thousand pounds sterling, and I have a neat
little share besides.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>&#8220;What! ten thousand pounds sterling? Is it
possible? Why, that firm of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice
must be very prosperous. I wish I
could get into a little of that kind of business
myself. My expenses of living are very great,
Captain, and I must make something by commerce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, General, that is a very easy
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Captain, are there any chances?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chances? Bless your soul, plenty, sir, plenty
sir,&#8221; said the Captain. &#8220;All that we need are
stern men, not too scrupulous and who can do
a thing in such a way that the right hand will
not know what the left hand does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; laughed Arnold. &#8220;Why, sir,
you know I used to be a trader myself at one
time,&mdash;a New England trader, sir. Before
the war, sir, I used to drive my team and sleigh
by way of Lake George to Canada and trade
Yankee notions for horses. Then I would drive
the horses overland and take them on a brig
to the West Indies and trade them there for
sugar, rum and molasses. So you see I am a
trader, sir,&mdash;a New England horse-trader.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you are a horse-trader, General, you
will do. We have an order from a merchant
in New York for two thousand barrels of flour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and we need a passport for the proper individual
to pass through our lines to New York and return
in order to effect the necessary business arrangements.
If the trade goes through successfully we
can afford to give you one third of the profits. We
expect confidently to make about $10,000 out of
the transaction in gold, and your share, General,
will surely be $3000.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s merely a business transaction between
private individuals and it will harm no one.
But, Captain, could you make any advances on
the profits, for I am very much in need of $1000
to-day and if it matters not to you, I will ask
you for this amount now?&#8221; eagerly questioned
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would willingly make it $1000, General,
only I have just $500 of gold with me; but I can
give you that,&#8221; as he counts out the gold on the
desk for General Arnold and keenly looks at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Captain, that will help me out.
It is settled,&#8221; said Arnold, as he grasped the gold
and put it into his pockets with avidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;But remember, simply give me the name
of the individual and I will furnish him with
the passport through our lines, but do not let me
know anything about his business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well, General, for commerce knows
no country,&#8221; were the concluding remarks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Captain Risk as he bowed and started for the
door. &#8220;I will be here to-morrow for the document.
Good day, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, sir, but bring the other $500 if
possible; I need it,&#8221; contended Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;If possible, General,&#8221; was the response, and
the privateersman left Arnold to go directly to
the office of Roderick Barclugh.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> FitzMaurice dinner and the reception
at Dorminghurst were revelations to Roderick
Barclugh. He learned that Arnold had a passion
for luxury and no discretion as to its cost; then
he became convinced that the lawyers and clergy
and merchants feared a democratic form of
government.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was possessed of wonderful
resources to accomplish his ends. The next
morning very early he sent his clerk for Captain
Samuel Risk of the Privateer Holker, in which
ship he held the controlling interest. Arnold&#8217;s
cupidity must be tried at once.</p>

<p>As Captain Risk came into Barclugh&#8217;s private
office, the first sound that greeted his ears was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Captain Risk, can you depend
on your crew to transfer two thousand barrels
of flour to a neutral ship flying the ensign of Holland
in a convenient harbor off Long Island?
There&#8217;s $20,000 to be divided up in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I can do it. State your necessities
in the case. What will be the ship&#8217;s share?&#8221;
was the prompt answer of the intrepid Captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;From private advices, a merchant in New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
York wants the flour for his account. I need a
passport to get to New York to have the money
advanced and the business concluded. Arnold
needs money and his share in the transaction
will be $3000, the ship&#8217;s share $10,000 and
protection from capture guaranteed. See Arnold
at once, and here is $500 to advance him for his
promise to deliver the passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agreed, Mr. Barclugh, and I&#8217;ll have that
vainglorious upstart tied up in this business
within an hour. I shall return here at once
with the prize,&#8221; was the reply of the gingery,
little, red-faced Captain as he went out the door
on his mission.</p>

<p>Barclugh turned to his clerk in the compting-room
and sent him to engage two thousand barrels
of flour for export on the Brigantine Holker from
Milling &amp; FitzMaurice, who now held merchandise
for the account of Roderick Barclugh in large sums&mdash;the
result of successful privateering cruises.
But as a matter of fact the flour shipment was merely
a cloak to carry on a deeper scheme. Barclugh
had constant communication with Sir Henry
Clinton, the British Commander, but he needed
a safe passport for himself to New York and
return in order to explain the details of his plot
to ensnare Arnold with British gold. He must
go in person to the British Commander-in-Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for the matter was of such delicate and intricate
nature that there must be no mishaps.</p>

<p>The flour transaction would simply pay the
expenses of the enterprise, because the difference
in the price of flour between New York and
Philadelphia was twelve dollars a barrel, and
the supply was very short at the former place.</p>

<p>While Barclugh was revolving these problems
in his mind, Captain Risk returned and stated
in his straightforward manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;The shark is securely hooked, and is desperately
in need of money. That young and
gay wife of his is an expensive luxury. He has
promised the passport, taken the $500 and wants
$500 more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is too much to advance. He will have
to wait for the balance till your return. The
$3000 promised him will lead him on to new
hopes in extravagance and he will be eager for
more when he gets his full share. Ha, ha! so
he took the gold eagerly, did he? Prosperity
intoxicates him. He has desperate courage, and
cares not for consequences to himself,&mdash;nor
to others. He is capable of as much evil as good
to his cause. Let&#8217;s see, Captain, I&#8217;ll have the
name for the passport ready to-morrow. You
may get your ship ready and load on the flour;
for, if the trade falls through, you can slip down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to Havana with your cargo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well, Mr. Barclugh, I&#8217;ll have my
crew shipped and the cargo loaded and be lying
in the stream awaiting your orders inside the
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Captain, if you should go to Havana
you will bring home one of those West Indian
fellows and then you will be able to retire and
buy an estate,&#8221; was the mirthful turn of Barclugh&#8217;s
planning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, sir. Then when I&#8217;m land-sick I
can sell a farm and go to sea. What a luxury
that would be! But I was never born to be
a land-lubber, sir. Good day, I&#8217;ll get the passport
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, Captain,&#8221; said Barclugh, as he
followed the skipper to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must use Arnold for our business,&#8221; rang
in the ears of Captain Risk from Barclugh, while
he walked jauntily off to go aboard his ship.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Risk</span> was astir early next morning,
called at the office of Roderick Barclugh, and
secured the fictitious name for the passport.
He then at once went to the office of General
Arnold on Market Street.</p>

<p>Arnold was in a happier mood than the day
previous. The expectancy of an easy $3000 had
given him a chance to see some relief from his
hopeless financial entanglements.</p>

<p>From the developments of the past few days
he thus reasoned to himself, as he paced nervously
up and down his small office floor:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever that $3000 is to come from there
surely must be more for me if my part of the
contract were zealously performed. But who
can be the person or persons that are carrying
through these transactions? Captain Risk is
only the skipper of the Privateer Holker; who
has the money? I&#8217;ll find out, by thunder! Just
give Arnold a chance. These pangs of debt
gnaw at the very core of my mental existence.
I would be honorable, but the slavery of financial
obligations drives me to desperate means of relief.
Money! money!! money!!! What would I not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
do just now for 20,000 pounds in gold? Ha, ha!
General Washington would not dare to reprimand
me for my extravagance. I would not dodge
every one then, fearing a demand for that which
I have not. Then,&mdash;O God, my wife&#8217;s social
position would be secure. To get money nowadays
you must look for it among those who have
it,&mdash;not among the poverty-stricken Colonists.
The English have money and, by thunder, they
have gratitude for the services of their generals.
If I had been fighting on the English side I would
not now have been begging. I would have had a
title,&mdash;Lord Arnold of Saratoga,&mdash;an estate, a
pension, and a settled position for myself and
family for such services as I rendered at Bemis
Heights. Bah! what reward have I now in
fighting for the rights of mankind? I ought
to fight for the glory of a King; then I would be
sensible; Mrs. Arnold tells me so, and she must
be right. But then, could I have fought in blinding
snowstorm from cake to cake of ice, and travelled
over snow in bare and bleeding feet, starved and
bled from gaping wounds, for money? Never!
never!! But then I was free, reckless, and wedded
to the profession of a soldier,&mdash;now I am linked
to the ambition and tastes of an aristocratic
lady. As a man to whom shall be my duty,&mdash;to
my country or to my wife? Arnold was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a coward,&mdash;my wife shall prevail!&#8221;</p>

<p>In such a reverie of conflicting thoughts was
Arnold wrapped, when a loud rap at the office
door caused him to face about and, assuming
a military posture, sharply command:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, General Arnold, I am here
for the passport, and we are ready to load the
flour and to start the messenger to New York.
The messenger&#8217;s name is Pierre La Fitte,&#8221; was
the direct, businesslike way in which the little
sea-captain approached Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Captain Risk, but who are &#8216;<i>we</i>&#8217;
of whom you speak? You realize that you are
simply a sea-faring man, and very likely to turn
up in Davy Jones&#8217; locker; if, by any possible
mishap, this messenger, Pierre La Fitte, be intercepted,
and any suspicions aroused by any papers
found, I could be compromised at once, and I
would have no guarantee of fair treatment. I
must deal with your principal, whoever he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well said, General Arnold, you must be secured
and protected. Remain here and you will have
this business all settled within an hour, and you
may have protection or whatever else you want
for that matter. Good day, sir,&#8221; was the snappy
answer of the little skipper, as he read the whole
import of Arnold&#8217;s fears, when he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
departed to let him wonder what was to happen
next.</p>

<p>When the skipper gained the outside, he explained
the situation to himself, as he reasoned
it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, he&#8217;s a shark! At first he wanted to know
nothing of the transaction, now he wants to know
all. But, howsomever, that Barclugh knows his
business and now that I have hooked the fish,
Barclugh will land him, shark and all that he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the door shut behind Captain Risk,
and Arnold had found himself addressed, explained,
and answered all in one jerk, so to speak,
he drew a long breath and said to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! what&#8217;s up now? What must these
people believe me to be? There must be money
where Risk does his business. Those privateersmen
are the only ones who are getting rich in
Philadelphia to-day. There&#8217;s Robert FitzMaurice,
Financier General of Congress, his warehouses
are full of captured merchandise and I know
that he would sell flour to anybody, even indirectly
to the enemy, if he could thereby show a good
balance on his ledger account. Philadelphia,
in traffic with the enemy, is rotten. I must
now know where it is going on, and who is at it.
Maybe, I was too eager with Captain Risk.
He&#8217;s gone without leaving a clue. I guess my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
chance is up. When I actually must have money,
what a fool I was to ask for his principal in the
matter. I might have known that Risk would
not have divulged his principal. But I wonder
why they sent Risk to me for a passport, anyway?
This business has been done before and they
did not need a passport. For some reason they
need me. Therein lies my chance, and by
thunder, Mrs. Arnold will be rich yet, even though
I used to be a New England horse-trader.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Arnold had fears and hopes of his success
in mind, Barclugh had listened to Arnold&#8217;s request
as given by Captain Risk and after the concise
narrative, Barclugh simply said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, you have done your duty. Leave
the rest to me. Load your ship, and sail with
the flour to the appointed rendezvous at the entrance
of Sag Harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well, Mr. Barclugh. I&#8217;m better at
running a blockade or overhauling a lime-juicer
than in handling a horse-trading shark,&#8221; was
the blurting opinion of the Yankee skipper, as
he tripped out of the compting-room of Roderick
Barclugh,&mdash;little knowing that he had played
the preliminary part in a nation&#8217;s drama.</p>

<p>The time was momentous on Arnold&#8217;s hands
as he pulled at his hair to think that he had lost
his opportunity with Captain Risk, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
door of the office opened, and there stood Roderick
Barclugh.</p>

<p>Arnold, wondering who was Risk&#8217;s principal,
stared in amazement at Barclugh&#8217;s presence.
But Barclugh at once knew that boldness was
his weapon to use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good morning, Mr. Barclugh, I am
very glad to see you,&#8221; said Arnold. &#8220;Will you
be seated?&#8221; as he walked to the door and told
the orderly to admit no one, and then bolted
the door behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold,&#8221; said Barclugh, &#8220;do you
mean business about this flour transaction?&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold put on his most gracious air and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am entirely in <i>touch</i> with the enterprise,
Mr. Barclugh, but I was obliged to require some
token of good faith on the part of the principals.
So you see I could not give Captain Risk the passport
until I had arranged with the responsible
parties as to the ways and means of getting out
of the scrape in case of complications arising.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What token do you require, General Arnold,
on my part?&#8221; coolly asked Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is a simple matter for men of substance,
Mr. Barclugh. You see I have bought
an estate on the Schuylkill and am in debt; I
keep up my house in town and my pay is entirely
inadequate for the tastes of my family, so, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
you could loan me a few thousand pounds in gold,
I could serve you on this occasion and possibly
on others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very right, General, about your
pay being too small to support a gentleman&#8217;s
family. To be candid with you, what you need
is money. If I were to put you in the way of
securing twenty thousand pounds sterling, would
you accept the proposition? Merely a proposition
to do your country a lasting benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Barclugh, I am dying daily
of chagrin, and money is my only salvation.
I would be willing to die ignominiously if I could
only secure my wife that much fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arnold, would you go over to the other party?
Would you consider consequences? Would you
honor the obligation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barclugh, a man that is the slave of the need
of money has no country, has no conscience,
has no will of his own. I am a slave. My
wife&#8217;s desires torment me as a lash. The abyss
opens before my eyes. My country&#8217;s cause can
never prevail against the wealth and resources
of Britain. To be loyal to America I would
die a pauper in a lost cause. To serve Britain
I would gain my desires,&mdash;victory and riches.
The die is cast, sir, command me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have now arrived at a sensible conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
General Arnold,&#8221; argued Barclugh. &#8220;There is
no use for you to be a beggar after such abilities
as you have shown and such services as you have
rendered your country. I am the direct representative
of His Majesty, George III. You
prepare the passports. Be candid with me, and
I can relieve your financial difficulties. I will
communicate with you in a few days; in the
meantime, come down to my office, and I will
loan you whatever money you need temporarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, sir,&#8221; concluded Barclugh, as he
left Arnold&#8217;s office, rejoicing to himself at Arnold&#8217;s
total subjection to money.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> conspirators engage to carry out
a plot, they at once begin to construct arguments
justifying means to their ends.</p>

<p>At the present day we observe oily worded
arguments made in the public press to gild the
corruption of virtue by the influence and power
of money; and no flight of the imagination is
required to determine exactly the same influence
at work to-day in our money-bag circles which
shows its corruption in the following letter addressed
to Arnold in 1778:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear General:</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the Americans who have joined the
rebel standard, there are very many good citizens
whose only object has been the happiness of their
country. Such, then, will not be influenced by
motives of private interest to abandon the cause
they have espoused. They are now offered
everything which can render the Colonies really
happy and this is the only compensation worthy
their virtue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American Colonies shall have their
Parliament, composed of two Chambers, with
all its members of American birth. Those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the upper house shall have titles and rank similar
to those of the House of Peers in England. All
their laws, and particularly such as relate to money
matters, shall be the production of this assembly,
with the concurrence of a Viceroy. Commerce
in every part of the globe subject to British sway
shall be as free to the people of the thirteen
Colonies as to the English of Europe. They will
enjoy, in every sense of the phrase, the blessings
of good government. They shall be sustained,
in time of need, by all the power necessary to
uphold them, without being themselves exposed
to the dangers or subjected to the expenses that
are always inseparable from the conditions of a
state.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such are the terms proffered by England at
the very moment when she is displaying extraordinary
efforts to conquer the obedience of her
Colonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall America remain, without limitation of
time, a scene of desolation,&mdash;or are you desirous
of enjoying peace and all the blessings of her
train? Shall your provinces, as in former days,
flourish under the protection of the most puissant
nation of the world? Or will you forever pursue
that shadow of liberty which still escapes from
your hands, even when in the act of grasping it?
And how soon would that very liberty, once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
obtained, turn into licentiousness, if it be not
under the safeguards of a great European power?
Will you rely upon the guarantee of France?
They among you whom she has seduced may
assume that her assistance will be generous and
disinterested, and that she will never exact from
you a servile obedience. They are frantic with
joy at the alliance already established, and promise
you that Spain will immediately follow the example
of France. Are they ignorant that each of these
has an equal interest in keeping you under,
and will combine to accomplish their end? Thousands
of men have perished; immense resources
have been exhausted; and yet since that fated
alliance the dispute has become more embittered
than ever. Everything urges us to put a conclusion
to dissensions,&mdash;not less detrimental to the victors
than to the vanquished; but desirable as peace is,
it cannot be negotiated between us as between
two independent powers; it is necessary that a
decisive advantage should put Britain in a condition
to dictate the terms of reconciliation.
It is her interest, as well as her policy, to make
these as advantageous to one as the other; but
it is at the same time advisable to arrive at it
without any unnecessary waste of that blood
of which we are already as sparing as though it
were again our own.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8220;There is but General Arnold who can surmount
obstacles so great as these. A man of
so much courage will never despair of the Republic,
even when every door to a reconciliation seems
sealed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Render then, brave General, this important
service to your country! The Colonies can not
sustain much longer the unequal strife. Your
troops are perishing in misery. They are badly
armed, half naked and crying for bread. The
efforts of Congress are futile against the languor
of the people. Your fields are untilled, trade
languishes, learning dies. The neglected education
of a whole generation is an irreparable loss
to society. Your youth, torn by thousands from
their rustic pursuits of useful employments, are
mown down by war. Such as survive have lost
the vigor of their prime or are maimed in battle;
the greater part bring back to their families the
idleness and corrupt manners of the camp. Let
us put an end to so many calamities; you and
ourselves have the same origin, the same language,
the same laws. We are inaccessible in our island;
and you, the masters of a vast and fertile territory,
have no other neighbors than the people of our
loyal Colonies. We possess rich establishments
in every quarter of the globe, and reign over
the fairest portions of Hindustan. The ocean is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
our home, and we pass across it as a monarch
traversing his dominions. From the Northern
to the Southern pole, from the East to the West
our vessels find everywhere a neighboring
harbor belonging to Great Britain. So many
islands, so many countries acknowledging our
sway, are all ruled by a uniform system that
bears on every feature the stamp of liberty, yet
it is well adapted to the genius of different nations
and various climes.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the continental powers ruin themselves
by war, and are exhausted in erecting the ramparts
that separate them from each other, our
bulwarks are our ships. They enrich us; they
protect us; they provide us as readily with the
means of invading our enemies as of succoring
our friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware, then, of breaking forever the link
and ties of friendship whose benefits are proven
by the experience of a hundred and fifty years.
Time gives to human institutions a strength
which what is new can only attain in its turn,
by the lapse of ages. Royalty itself experiences
the need of this useful prestige, and the line that
has reigned over us for the past sixty years has
been illustrious for ten centuries.</p>

<p>&#8220;United in equality, we will rule the universe;
we will hold it bound, not by arms and violence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but by the ties of commerce,&mdash;the lightest and
most gentle bonds that human kind can wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Allowing sufficient time for the arguments
of this letter to crystallize his determination,
Arnold was entrapped. Barclugh had analyzed
what effect the document would have on Arnold&#8217;s
mind; he knew that vanity alone would lead him
to commit treason on the pretext that he might
save his country from desolation and ruin, so that
he could be the master-key in the great drama.
To end the war at one stroke and receive the
pecuniary gratitude of the English government
and to stand out in history like Brutus, or Monk,
or Marlborough, as the creator of kings or governments,
was the dream of an adventurous spirit.
Arnold loved dramatic display. Battlefields had
provided him a theatre for the exercise of his
valor; garrison duty at Philadelphia had given
him the allurements of social dissipations; the
need of money and the glitter of kingly promises
were for him the crucial tests of honor which
sunk his career.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was in Arnold&#8217;s office the
next day at midnight, and thus addressed his
victim:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, you of all Americans can
end this cruel war with the mother country.
So if you receive twenty thousand pounds in gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and a commission as General in the British Army,
and a pension of two thousand pounds sterling
per annum for life, what can you do to endow
your countrymen with the blessings of peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; said Arnold, &#8220;I shall be
inflicting enduring good upon humanity to stop
the vain sacrifices of Americans in a forlorn cause.
I would re-establish trade and friendly relations
at home and abroad. The name of Arnold
would be a synonym for the savior of this country.
There would be no need, then, for a Washington.
I would be the founder of great prosperity and
happiness, and my natal day would be cherished
by the,&mdash;well, by the nobility, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, I have thought of the best way for
us to accomplish the object: you see, West Point
is the citadel of American military hopes; if they
were to lose that stronghold, New England
could be cut off from the rest of the Colonies.
The control of the upper Hudson falls with
West Point. Communications would then be
cut between New England and the Southern
Colonies. The rebel forces would then be merely
local bands, and the commanders partisan
leaders. Then another British force could invade
Virginia and each section be subdued in detail,
but after the fall of West Point the Colonists
would be glad to make terms of peace. Bloodshed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
would then be stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can secure the command of West Point
from the Commander-in-Chief, and when once
in the coveted position, then Americans and American
destiny will be at my feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your plan is an inspired one, General Arnold,
and here are two thousand pounds in Bills of
Exchange on the Bank of Amsterdam, which
you can get cashed at my office as a token of my
faith in you. Now, with my passport in my
pocket I shall start at once by way of West Point
for New York, and carry the good news to General
Clinton. Be sure and communicate with General
Washington at once for your assignment to your
new command,&#8221; were the parting words of
Roderick Barclugh, as he mounted his horse
at daylight to begin his journey through the
Jersey Highlands, under the disguise and name
of Pierre La Fitte.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Roderick Barclugh left the office of
General Arnold, he mounted his horse and took
the Germantown road. The hour was just
before dawn, and much fatigue after the exciting
negotiations with the traitor caused Barclugh
to ride briskly, while serious meditations flitted
through his brain:</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Washington think of Arnold&#8217;s
request for assignment to West Point? I must
pave the way for Arnold&#8217;s success. If I could
only meet General Washington, being armed
with the letter of Robert FitzMaurice, I would
encourage the General to favor Arnold and
explain away his unrest at Philadelphia. I could
praise his deeds at Saratoga; how he longed for
active service; his marriage and its financial
obligations. The desire to please his wife entangled
Arnold in unwarranted expenditures.
To assign such a valuable leader to a post away
from all allurements of society would preserve
a valuable leader for active service after his
wound had healed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus he mused, while his horse alternately
galloped and walked, until he realized that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sun had risen, and he found that he had reached
the seat of his friend, Dr. William Greydon, who
had urged him to stop at Dorminghurst, whenever
he should have business that way.</p>

<p>Knowing that he might have greater need of
his horse later on in the course of his perilous
journey, he considered it wisdom to stop and
spend the day for rest and gather his thoughts
and energy for a long ride the next day. He also
wished to travel incognito and the less he stopped
at public houses, the better his purpose was
helped along.</p>

<p>To stop at Dorminghurst did not require any
length of argument, as Barclugh was young
and still susceptible. Neither had he forgotten
Miss Mollie Greydon who was at the dinner
party of the Financier General; Barclugh recalled
her beauty and intellectual qualities.</p>

<p>Riding between the hemlocks to the mansion,
Roderick Barclugh was struck with the taste
of this American home. As he dismounted
he was greeted by the master of the house on
the portico, while his horse was attended by a
watchful black servant. The welcome he received
was in true Colonial fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, Mr. Barclugh, you have made good
your promise to break bread with me. I know
that you must have risen early, so we can breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
at once,&#8221; was the greeting of Dr. William
Greydon.</p>

<p>Turning to the servant, Dr. Greydon continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Care for Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s horse and bring his
saddle-bags into the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; replied Barclugh, &#8220;starting on this
journey last night, I was detained with a friend
arranging my business until early morning. I
am on a long journey to the Commander-in-Chief
at Fishkill, and I thought best to make
my journey in short stages at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wise, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; replied his host,
&#8220;and I am sure Dorminghurst is honored with
your presence.&#8221; Bowing courteously as Mr.
Barclugh entered the great hallway, Dr. Greydon
ushered his guest to the staircase, and left him
in the hands of a trusted man-servant who led
the way to the guest-chamber.</p>

<p>After the customary formalities of presenting
himself to his host and family in the library,
breakfast was served in the rear hall.</p>

<p>The easy manners of gentlemen&#8217;s families
during the Revolution were a blessing to travelers.
Open houses, hearty welcome to soldiers, was
the rule among patriots, and hospitality was as
free and unpolluted as sparkling spring water.</p>

<p>What impressed Roderick Barclugh as remarkable,
was the frank and unaffected manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
which he was greeted by the daughter and brilliant
wife of Dr. Greydon. Their &#8220;thee&#8217;s&#8221; and
&#8220;thou&#8217;s&#8221; were not assumed in addressing a guest
who happened in; for the Greydons had traveled
in Europe, and Dr. Greydon was a graduate
in Medicine of Cambridge University.</p>

<p>There is risk to young women in early morning
calls. If ever a young woman is seen in her true
self, that time is at her own breakfast table.
No one appreciated such a fact more keenly than
Roderick Barclugh. Therefore, when he presented
himself for this early breakfast he greeted
Mrs. Greydon and Miss Mollie with these words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mollie, I am surprised to find you astir
so early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed the young Quakeress, &#8220;Mr.
Barclugh, I have already translated forty lines
of Horace for father, as well as directed the churning
for mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful! Bravo!! Miss Greydon, I have
much respect for the young woman who can
combine the graces of odes of the greatest Latin
poet along with the duties of domestic economy,
and all before breakfast,&#8221; exclaimed Barclugh. &#8220;I
believe, however, that Horace sings of the vine,
the bees, the grain, the cattle, and the thrifty
housewife. I am really delighted to find some
one so practically refined,&#8221; continued the guest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Mollie Greydon was a perfectly happy and
healthy girl, who enjoyed being busy and useful.
She was dressed this morning in a neat and
becoming homespun of her father&#8217;s loom. Her
form was well rounded and her face was animated
and possessed of one of those kindly benevolent
expressions that are heaven-born. Her eyes
were hazel-brown, large and deep-set, which
indicated stable character and mental penetration.
Her hair was brown, and worn combed back,
high and plain.</p>

<p>There was nothing of the ascetic or complaining
nature about her. She was a wholesomely good
and reasonable girl, ready and willing to accept
any station in life in which she happened to
be cast,&mdash;always ready to perform her full duty,
no matter in what sphere. If she were linked to the
fortunes of an honorable pioneer or to the luxury
of a Colonial gentleman, she would have no grievances.
Mollie Greydon was conscious of her
ability to render her full duty in life and therefore
the equipoise of her countenance and the grace
of her mind and body were discernible in whatever
she did. She had much energy, but still had
discretion to keep much in reserve. She had
lively passions and a temper which any worthy
person must respect, but the judgment in its
use was the work of a master mind. She quarreled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
with no one but the open enemies of her country,
and the advocates of aristocracy. Her young
days had been intermingled with all the contemporary
men of ideas, since she was her father&#8217;s
companion, and always at his side. The social
and domestic life of Dorminghurst, the intellectual
atmosphere of her home, and the advantages
of meeting all the distinguished men of
the times around her father&#8217;s fireside, had rounded
out the qualities of a gifted young woman, which
she was.</p>

<p>The breakfast was plain and substantial, composed
of hominy and milk, and sugar-cured
ham, with a corn cake and a cup of coffee; also
potatoes that were boiled. Roderick Barclugh
had an unerring opportunity to study the bearing
of Miss Mollie in all its details. He asked her
several pointed questions for the only purpose
of sounding her philosophy on current affairs,
and on her views of life in the colonies.</p>

<p>Among other questions one was addressed
to her with an earnest gaze from Barclugh&#8217;s
penetrating eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mollie, have you no young lady companions
near at hand to help you pass the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; came the prompt and
decided answer of the young Quakeress. &#8220;I
have very few. My father and my mother are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
my most constant companions. One tutors me
in the classics, almost daily, and the other instructs
me in all the duties of our household.
I am, therefore, very busy at my books, the
spinning, the weaving, the oversight of the dairy
and the poultry-yards. I have my circle of
friends in Philadelphia and I attend some of the
entertainments given there; but in these stirring
times, when our countrymen need clothes and
food, I owe all of my energy to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, Miss Greydon, you are truly in
earnest about this war. Let me see,&#8221; laughingly
remarked Barclugh, &#8220;do you really believe that
the Colonists can possibly succeed in their efforts
to win independence? Will not your zeal have
been spent in vain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; came her reply in girlish
enthusiasm, &#8220;you remember that Wolsey, in the
time of Henry VIII, said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;Had I but serv&#8217;d my God with half the zeal</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;I serv&#8217;d my king, he would not in mine age</div>
<div class="verse">&#8216;Have left me naked to mine enemies.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And I can assure you that I believe when I serve
this country for the principles of independence
and equality of the people, I am serving my God.
So I have heard Mr. Franklin say to father,
and he must be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to his host and hostess at each end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the breakfast table, and to Miss Greydon,
who sat opposite, Barclugh looked at each one
earnestly, while he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;This young lady must be inspired.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the purpose of disclaiming any credit
to herself, the young lady, with all the sincerity
of a child, laughed with animation, as she tried
to explain her wisdom:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Barclugh, you must not think so.
For the past five years we have heard nothing
discussed at our tables, at our firesides, and
on every occasion, nothing but the &#8216;Rights of
Man,&#8217; &#8216;Common Sense,&#8217; &#8216;Age of Reason,&#8217; &#8216;The
Declaration of Independence,&#8217; &#8216;The Tyranny
of Kings,&#8217; and &#8216;The Corruption of Aristocracy,&#8217;
until their doctrines have become household
words. I have imbibed them, absorbed them,
and discussed them, so I feel that every word
I utter is the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. and Mrs. Greydon let the younger people
occupy each other&#8217;s attention and listened with
smiles of satisfaction at the readiness with which
their only daughter was able to expound the
sentiments of the household.</p>

<p>However, Dr. Greydon turned to his guest,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, I must let you know that
Mollie is my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Miss Greydon, there is no mistaking
two things; that you are right and that you are
sincere. After this, you may be sure that you
have my respect and my esteem,&#8221; were the admissions
of Roderick Barclugh, and a deep
emotion came over his whole frame, as the crimson
blush of blood rose out of his body, and enveloped
his neck and ears and face.</p>

<p>Here was an unaffected and honest Colonial
girl of nineteen, who had brought this diplomat
to bay.</p>

<p>While thinking of his journey and mission the
thought flashed through his mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;Magna est veritas et prevalibit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing but monosyllables could Barclugh utter
after this upheaval in his breast, produced by
the wisdom and truth stated by the innocent
young soul who sat opposite him at table. Small-talk
about the farm and city relieved his predicament
until breakfast was over.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon and Barclugh enjoyed a social
pipe in the library after breakfast, until the
Doctor suggested:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you have been awake all night the best
thing for you to do is to take a rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suggestion was eagerly taken up by Barclugh,
for he needed rest and seclusion. Therefore,
he excused himself, and went to his chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and sat down in a large chair with a resignation
becoming a better cause than his.</p>

<p>He began to think of the excitement of ensnaring
Arnold the night before, and then the
voice of that beautiful girl:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Had I but serv&#8217;d my God with half the zeal</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I serv&#8217;d my king....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>rang in his ears.</p>

<p>He jumped up and placed his clenched fists
in his hair, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, I am blushing again! What ails
me? I tremble. Oh, that face! that voice!
those words deep in wisdom! Great God! I
am in love!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He paced up and down his chamber. He took
off his shoes and outer garments and lay down
to sleep, but he could not. He tossed from side
to side; he jumped up and sat on the chair, but
no repose could he find.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I do? Shall I throw everything
overboard? Shall I renounce my mission, and
ask Miss Greydon to be my wife? No, I can
not do that, for the traitor, Arnold, has me in his
power. If I proceed in this nefarious business,
my life will not be right to meet this pure and
innocent soul on an equality.&#8221;</p>

<p>Straightening himself up and gazing out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the window, Barclugh saw the birds carrying
straws to build their nests, and the bees bringing
honey to the hive in the garden, and he mused
no longer but walked to and fro as he resolved:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Barclugh, brace thyself. Ah, I shall
proceed. I shall attempt both ends. If one
fail, perhaps the other will succeed. I know
which one I most desire.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must not linger here. To hear her
voice again I shall be lost. I must go very soon;
yes, at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh had now calmed and he lay down
again and slept soundly for two hours.</p>

<p>Awakening with a start, he dressed in haste,
and found his host and informed him that the
urgency of this business would not let him rest
longer.</p>

<p>Leaving his compliments for his hostess and
Miss Mollie with the Doctor, Barclugh mounted
his horse and galloped down the avenue of hemlocks
to the public road, and took the direction
of Trenton on the Delaware.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dearest thought of an American patriot
is the fact that, no matter how deep and powerful
the plots for aristocratic forms of government,
these ideas wither and die in embryo on the free
soil of America. The dreams of a Fairfax in
Virginia, the Patroons in New York, a Blennerhasset
in the Ohio Valley, were never to be
realized in the free air of America. The principle
of primogeniture found no favor in the new land
of hope and refuge. The Covenanters in Pennsylvania
and the valley of Virginia, the Puritans
in New England, the Quakers in Pennsylvania,
the Catholics in Maryland, the Debtors in Georgia,
all left British soil with grievances which were
to be righted in the wilderness.</p>

<p>All of those who were favored with prosperity
remained at home, and they were largely the
first-born sons, or entailed heirs. The underlings
cleared out to the wild-woods. How could the
mother country expect, therefore, conformity
to her system of aristocratic estates, if those
who sought the Colonies left home smarting under
the inequality shown to the younger sons? The
laws of Britain had, through generations, elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the first-born and pauperized the junior offspring,
till at last the American Revolution could with
propriety be named the uprising of the younger
sons of Britain for equality. Can Englishmen
wonder, therefore, to-day, that Americans have
no patience with English aristocracy and royalty?
Any statesman who would emulate English social
systems in America may be prepared for an
avalanche.</p>

<p>However, there is one relic of old England&#8217;s
musty law tomes with which the younger sons
may again have to measure swords, if not settled
by peaceful and constitutional means. That
is a law analogous to the law of entailed estates,
which maintains inequality in like manner between
individuals. The growth has been gradual
and unseen until recent years; but at the same
time producing rumblings in the hearts of the
unfavored persons. <i>Primogeniture</i> maintained
inequality between brothers and sisters in the
family; the other creates an inequality in finance
and commerce, <i>in perpetuo</i>, by means of an
artificial person, endowed with a legal immortality
which destroys all individualism. That fiction
of vested rights is the stock corporation under the
genius and authority of the Common Law of
England.</p>

<p>No matter how safe Americans may feel against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the introduction of aristocratic laws and forms
of government, still, spasmodically and industriously,
attempts have been made to supplant
the idea of equality before the law, by legislation
for the favored ones.</p>

<p>The mission of Roderick Barclugh to the new
world was to crush out the struggle for liberty
by means of bribery and at the same time to
imitate those laws of England, which would bind
the social conditions of England upon the Colonists
forever. Against the rebels, the outcome of the
War for Independence seemed such a foregone
conclusion, that already Roderick Barclugh was
scheming to advance his own social prestige
which his zeal for the King of England promised.
He expected to be Viceroy of the Colonies, and
to receive the title of Lord Barclugh of Allegheny.</p>

<p>The matter had been so far decided and planned
that the letter to Arnold explicitly stated that
the Parliament of the Colonies would have an
upper house of Lords of the Realm who were
to receive their patents of nobility from the King
of England. The thought of independence was
ridiculed by the English; so what could more
properly occupy the thoughts of Barclugh than
his exalted position when England should subdue
the rebels?</p>

<p>His mind was set upon creating one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
most extensive landed estates to which noble
blood could lay claim. He would receive one
of those royal grants of land out of the public
domain in Western Pennsylvania, equal to a
principality. He would build such a castle
that its renown would live through ages. The
tenantry would be bound to the soil from generation
to generation, paying their rents for the
privilege of bare existence upon the lands of a
noble lord. The miller&#8217;s son would be a miller,
the blacksmith&#8217;s boy would be a blacksmith,
the ploughman&#8217;s boy would be a ploughman,
toiling without hope and without ambition; for
the privilege of equality would be denied them
under the English social system.</p>

<p>The consuming thought of Barclugh in all
these stirring panoramas was the founding of
a noble family that would emblazon the crest
of Barclugh high in the fields of statesmanship
and war.</p>

<p>But how was such a problem to be accomplished?
Should he wait until his honors had fallen to him,
and then go home and ally his name with one
of the great houses and names of English nobility?
Or should he seek among the best blood in the
Colonies, a lady out of the representatives of
wealth, gentility, and intellect, because such
an one would be inured to the customs and privations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of pioneers which a <i>grande dame</i> from
ancestral halls could never endure? Either one
course or the other must be chosen. For land
and heirs are necessary appendages to successful
nobles. Land without heirs is a misfortune;
but heirs without lands or wealth, among aristocrats,
had better been unborn.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was not in the habit of
jumping at conclusions. Thus in the selection
of his bride he had weighed every influence upon
the future of his posterity and his estate. He
had calculated that his helpmate must be capable
of maintaining, by means of her accomplishments,
grace of person, and intellect, his exalted social
eminence. She must be respected by the Colonial
social leaders in order that the administration
of the vice-regal office should be deservedly
popular. Though to make doubly sure of his
results, Barclugh had determined to wed before
his mission to America was divulged and before
his emoluments and honors were known. If
he were to be accepted in his proposals for marriage
he would be desired for himself, and not as Viceroy
of the most powerful monarch on earth.
Once settled in his marital affairs he could open
up to his bride the honors of his position, and
the power which would rest in her hands.
Dreams of William the Conqueror parcelling out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
estates and titles to his favorites welled up in
the mind of Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What woman would not enjoy such a position?&#8221;
thought he. &#8220;Not a vestige of the former
principles of equality and democracy would
be tolerated; every semblance of the principles
of the Declaration of Independence would be
crushed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But who was to be the fortunate or unfortunate
object of all these plans and conceptions of power
and grandeur,&mdash;the one on whom would devolve
all the prestige of founding a new order of barons,&mdash;whose
will might be the arbiter and maker of
titles for American families in the new regime
of nobility and aristocracy?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1699 the ebb and flow of the Delaware&#8217;s
tide were slipping placidly by the City of Brotherly
Love, when the founder of Dorminghurst first
saw the sphere of his future labors. He was
but five and twenty years of age, and the good
ship Canterbury brought him hither as secretary
of the Proprietor and Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>He was tall and athletic; a fine scholar, versed
in Latin, Greek, French and Spanish. He was
a member of the Society of Friends. Imbued
with all the ambition of a young, vigorous and
refined manhood, James Greydon prospered under
the patronage of his benefactor, William Penn.
He attended to all the official correspondence
of the Colony of Pennsylvania, and to all the
private accounts and business of the Proprietor
of the Colony. He was a faithful steward to a
good and liberal man. He attended all the
meetings which William Penn held with the
Indian tribes for the purpose of buying lands
west of the Susquehanna. The details of these
vast transactions rested in the able hands of
James Greydon.</p>

<p>All that tract of land lying on both sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the Susquehanna and the lakes adjacent, in or
near the Province of Pennsylvania, was confined
at this time by several treaties entered into with
the Conostogas, the Shawnees, the Iroquois,
the Susquehannas and the Onondagas,&mdash;all of
whom loved Penn and his friends; so that the
language of the treaty had these remarkable
words of brotherly relationship:</p>

<p>&#8220;They shall for ever hereafter be as one head
and one heart, and live in true friendship and
amity as one people.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Penn was obliged to return to England
in 1701, the management of his personal and
real estate in the Colony was left to James Greydon.
Greydon, therefore, had to receive the Indian
deputations, as well as to superintend all the
fur traffic with the tribes for the benefit of the
proprietor&#8217;s estate. He could hardly escape becoming
a large landlord by the opportunities
thrust into his way in the routine of his duties.</p>

<p>However, the mere acquirement of riches
was not gratifying to James Greydon. He not
only wished to establish his family comfortably
in the enjoyments of a large estate, but he cherished
even more highly those graces of mind and body,
which accompany the love of books and learning.</p>

<p>Consequently, a few years after his establishment
in the Colony and his marriage to a daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of a wealthy merchant, he consolidated his earnings
into several large tracts of land between
Philadelphia and the settlement of Friends
called Germantown. He named the estate
&#8220;Dorminghurst.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mansion was finished in 1728. At the
start, the family occupied the beautiful spot
for a summer resort. Many times its master
rode from Philadelphia on his finely-bred horse
to superintend the clearing of fields, the planting
of fruit trees and the setting out of rare shrubs
for landscape effects. His pride was aroused
in laying out and adorning with hemlocks an
avenue which was to be the grand approach to
his mansion. While out in the wilderness west
of the Susquehanna surveying his possessions,
the beauty of the native hemlocks amazed him
so forcibly that he gathered, with his own hands,
one hundred young trees, and upon his return
to Dorminghurst in the autumn had them re-planted
for the glory of his own handiwork.
Hawthorns, walnuts, hazels and fruit trees sent
out by William Penn from England found appropriate
spots each year for the embellishment of
James Greydon&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>Nature had provided Dorminghurst with many
attractive features. The primeval forest of oaks,
elms and maples needed only the exercise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
taste and the use of artistic judgment to convert
the undulating natural landscapes into lasting
impressions of the beautiful. To cull out the
obtruding exuberance of the primitive woodland
was a triumph of art. To create a vista of the
rivulet, Wingohocking, crooking up a little valley,
and to present expanding miles of swelling meadows
over which grazed sleek cattle, sometimes
resting under a lone magnolia or a group of
beeches, were passions in the heart of a devotee
of Virgil&#8217;s Georgics. The sloping of the ground
in all directions from the site of the mansion-house
allowed the broad avenue between the
hemlocks to curve around each side of the buildings.
One way a serpentine road descended
through a dense wild-wood grove, and then meandered
through the gully, giving perspectives
or vistas through the shadowy treetops; the
other way skirted enclosures for fruits and esculents
on one side, and on the other passed broad
lawns rising and falling in harmony &#8217;midst the
clumps of spruces, pines and firs.</p>

<p>The development of a family seat in the early
Colonial times aroused all the latent energies
and pride of its founder. All the true domestic
instincts found gratification in first choosing
a picturesque location and then unfolding plans
for landscape gardening. Problems arose. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
manufacture of the brick, and the hewing of the
timbers, from off the proprietor&#8217;s own soil,
the construction of a mill on the stream to grind
his own grain, and the building of his smoke-house,
brew-house, a place for his loom, his
dairy, and his ashery, rounded out the domestic
economy of a Colonial gentleman.</p>

<p>The realizations of every domestic felicity
were found in these establishments. The capital
sprung from the soil, and the labor bestowed
brought forth bountiful fruits of the earth, which
are sweet to all true men. These treasuries of a
home and the securities for a future were sounder
and more human than an up-to-date gentleman&#8217;s
commercial assets which are artificial and sometimes
of fictitious origin. No market quotations
ruined the Colonial home.</p>

<p>After the needs of the home were supplied
from the soil, from the spinning-wheel and loom
and the dairy and the poultry-yard, the surplus
could be traded for the small needs of money.
The Colonist was supported by nature&#8217;s products
direct from the soil; the man of the present is
the offspring of artificial institutions of money
and of corporations&mdash;the slave of vested rights,
whose origins have mostly been the unearned
increment.</p>

<p>But, aside from the domestic felicity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Colonial families, the social phases of their lives
were no less distinguished than their hospitable
homes. After the mansion was built and the
servants or slaves well ordered; after the smoke-house
was full of meat; after the mill was full
of grain; the home-made ale or cider in the cellar;
the spinners and weavers busy at the warp and
woof; the travelling shoemaker busy at the year&#8217;s
foot-wear (made from the home-tanned leather),
what could deter the natural social proclivities
of these people? The cares of an artificial man
were unknown. The dames had quilting and
spinning-bees, while the men had hunting contests,
which were decided by the best filled bags. Entertainment
and hospitality shown to house-parties
would last for days. The housewives vied with
each other to see their husbands and families
clothed in the finest textures of their own manufacture.
Each household tried to produce the
finest ale of its own brewing, and to establish
reputations for its cakes, mince pies and doughnuts.
The gossip of the neighborhood was
exchanged by the housewives; the men traded
horses and sheep and swine; they all danced,
dined, played games and made merry; so, then,
what more could they ask for pleasure?</p>

<p>Dorminghurst grew out of the forest under the
influence of a master mind. The mansion was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one of those plain, square, two-storied brick
structures,&mdash;dormer windows for the attic rooms,
and a detached kitchen in the rear (connected
with the large dining-hall by a covered passageway).
The office was built in line of the eastern
elevation of the dwelling, and connected with the
house by a covered way. The store-house,
smoke-house, brew-house and bakery, besides the
servants&#8217; quarters and the stables, were all built
of brick and formed a quadrangle enclosure and
a court in the center. The doors of all buildings
were massive oak and secured by the heaviest
fastenings of iron. All windows on the ground
floor had heavy shutters, and an underground,
secret passageway led from the house to a door
under the stables. The structures were enclosed
thus to guard against Indian attacks.</p>

<p>A handsome porch and steps led up to the
massive front door, which entered into the great
hall that extended through the middle of the
building. A double staircase, starting in the
middle of the great central hall, met on a common
landing, which led to the sleeping chambers.
Large double parlors on each side of the hallway
were connected by folding doors. The large,
well-lighted front room on the east side was used
as the library, and the large hallway to the rear
of the staircase was used as the dining and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
living-room. All the apartments had vast chimney-places,
commodious enough in the openings
to receive huge logs of wood for good cheer in
winter. Grotesque blue and white tiles, imported
from Holland, embellished the massive brick-work
of the chimney, and above the mantels
were arched niches adorned with rare old china
and heavy silver-ware, which on state occasions
saw service at table.</p>

<p>The furniture of a Colonial house in 1730
partook, like the house itself, of simplicity, and
in design was more useful than ornamental.
Mahogany was little known in Pennsylvania,
yet used to some extent in the West Indies; oak
and black walnut served for the cabinet woods.
Chairs in profusion were found only in the houses
of the most substantial. Choicely carved chests-of-drawers,
cupboards, high-backed chairs and
tables found their way from Europe only by
the grace of ship-masters, so that imported
Colonial furniture was rare and expensive. However,
each town of importance had its list of
cabinet-makers and joiners who fashioned their
handiwork after the design of articles imported
and thus supplied the needs of the new country.</p>

<p>At Dorminghurst everything which was possible
to be constructed from material found on the
estate was made and fashioned right there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The timbers for the mansion and outbuildings
were hewn in the forest, and the lumber for
finishing the interior was sawed by hand on the
spot. Any pieces of oak or walnut that were
choice were saved and seasoned for the cabinet-work
and for the furniture. Half a dozen skilled
artisans were hired by the year and the workmanship
put upon the doors, the wainscotting
and the staircase was marvellous.</p>

<p>The front part of the great hallway had a lofty
ceiling, and was lighted by windows in the second
story.</p>

<p>The great double staircase flared out at the
foot and ascended by graceful curves, thus forming
an elliptical center space between the two banisters.
The effect upon entering the well-lighted
and lofty hallway was to command respect for
the mansion. After passing between two massive
and richly-carved newel posts, the elliptical opening
between the two staircases had hall seats
in comfortable nooks and the rear hall had a huge
fireplace and mantel at the very end. Two
massive oak settles, high in back, faced each
other on each side of the chimney-place, and one
could stretch out and lie down on either one of
them and be comfortable. A lengthy oaken
table with bandy legs stood in the center of the
hall. Two long forms or benches without backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
were on each side, and two massive, high-backed
chairs were at each end of the table. A damask
cover was on the table, and the floor was bare
and scrupulously white. In entertaining company
the great hall was in popular favor.</p>

<p>At this table James Greydon used to entertain
his intimates, and he loved to sit and
discourse upon topics of the day. He was a
Latin scholar and scientific writer of no mean
ability. In the ripeness of his attainments he
produced a translation of Cicero&#8217;s &#8220;De Senectute,&#8221;
which was the first production in America of
classical scholarship. At Dorminghurst he collected,
for a Colonist, a wonderful library of
classical authors.</p>

<p>The well-lighted front room on the first floor
was lined with shelves, on which rested shining
lights of literature, to guide the effort and ambition
of struggling genius in the wilderness of Pennsylvania.
An untimely accident had crippled James
Greydon, so that for thirty years of his latter life
his time was spent almost entirely among his books
and in his farming pursuits. He wrote valuable
treatises on agriculture, for the then primitive
Colonists, and collected precious editions of
Cicero, Virgil, Seneca, Pliny and Horace, to
say nothing of the lesser lights of Latin literature.</p>

<p>He also collected valuable editions of Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
writers on philosophy, history, verse and the
drama. These were the most distinguished collections
of classical works to be used at this
early date for the benefit of American learning.
James Greydon was one of the fathers of scholarship
in the New World. He was in correspondence
with many scholars and men of letters in Europe.
He was the great friend and co-laborer of Franklin,
who acquired his knowledge of Latin and Greek
from Greydon&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>The quadrant, of such benefit to mariners
and explorers, was invented by an artisan under
the encouragement of Greydon, at Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>The numerous pamphlets and treatises produced
by Greydon on the science of agriculture
and on politics were the products of Franklin&#8217;s
press. Even the noted work of the translation
of &#8220;De Senectute&#8221; which was printed by Franklin
(to whom credit at the time was sometimes given
for the authorship of the work) was performed by
James Greydon.</p>

<p>But the crowning distinction for which Dorminghurst
shall be known, was the reverence in which
its master was held by the red men of the forest.
Keen in the detection and appreciation of true
manhood, the native instincts of the Indian
shunned the commercialism of the grasping English
office-holder; but the pure and simple line of conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the scholar and philosopher commanded the
respect and esteem of those children of nature&mdash;the
Indians. Deputations of the fierce Iroquois
and the Shawnees and the Susquehannas
travelled far and long to listen to the counsel and
wisdom of the distinguished sage and philosopher
of Dorminghurst. The Indians learned to trust
his word and advice so well that his estate became,
at length, the Mecca for an annual gathering of
his forest friends, and the permanent abode of a
few of the descendants of Altamaha.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> times the long avenue of hemlocks was
honored by the gathering of the tribes of red men
at Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>Before entering the city for their business with
the Governor and Council at Philadelphia, the
Indians invariably camped on the estate of the
big white chief, James Greydon, as a mark of
respect to their friend. Usually the exchange
of courtesies could best be accomplished by preparing
a feast for the assembled tribesmen.</p>

<p>On the day set apart for the feast, the tribesmen
approached the mansion through the avenue of
hemlocks. They were clothed in their best
buckskin leggings, skin robes and moccasins,
and bedecked with plumage and trinkets. No
arms or tomahawks were carried, because the
Indians respected the Quakers&#8217; dislike of war.
They seated themselves in respectful silence on
each side of the avenue under the spreading
trees, while the servants were busied covering the
white tables with dozens of roasted turkeys,
ducks, chickens, saddles of venison,&mdash;roasted
before an open fire,&mdash;roasts of beef, pyramids of
doughnuts and apples, great pies and cakes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
then light bread cut into slices. All this provision
met the eyes of the hungry savage, as he sat
smoking his kin-ni-kin-nick.</p>

<p>An occasional grunt of satisfaction issued out
of the shade of the hemlocks, whenever a chief,
between puffs at his pipe, assented to the monosyllables
of the others. The groups were picturesque,
seated and grouped around the trees of the spacious
lawn. Dignity, becoming a noble race, was
written in the lofty mien and countenance of
every face. If ever Indians were happy, they were,
in partaking of the generous hospitality of this
noble Quaker, who was the successor of their
great father, William Penn.</p>

<p>The importance of a tribal feast to the Colonists,
in 1732, had much weight with the principal
men of the State. The distinguished men of the
province travelled long distances to be present
at these gatherings given by the master of Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>The feast began when the Secretary led out of
his mansion an assemblage of gay ladies and
gentlemen. James Greydon led them down the
wide avenue of hemlocks, bowing and smiling
to the natives. They all proceeded to a lofty
and spreading oak, accompanied by the great
Chief, Altamaha. When the ladies were seated
and the gentlemen grouped about, the Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the Onondagas, Altamaha, stepped forward
and gave a short command. At once the whole
body of Indians came forward and squatted on
the ground in the form of a half-moon, facing the
white people. The chiefs formed a group distinct
from the other tribesmen within the circle facing
James Greydon.</p>

<p>When the Indians had taken their places
James Greydon advanced with solemnity to address
his guests:</p>

<p>&#8220;My children: The spirit of our great father,
William Penn, calls us together again. I welcome
you as his children. We are all his children.
We have been driven from our homes by the
persecutions of the English. We seek our homes
among the children of the Great Spirit of the
forest, the red men; we are brothers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We love our brothers; if they come to our
wigwams, hungry, we give them food; we do not
make war upon them in their hunting-grounds;
we love peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Spirit who rules the heavens and
the earth knows that the children of William
Penn have a hearty desire to live in peace and
friendship with you. Your friend and great
father, William Penn, retained a warm affection
for all the Indians and commanded all those
whom he sent to govern the Quakers to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the Indians as his children; he continued in this
love for them until his death.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brethren: Your hearts have been clean
and you have preserved the pledge of friendship
long ago made for your great father&#8217;s children,
and the chain has no breaks or rust; you have
never forgotten the great love which our father,
William Penn, had for you.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends: May your young men learn from
you what your great father said to you before
he went to his happy hunting-grounds. May our
chain of friendship never be broken and may
it endure between our children and our children&#8217;s
children, and may it last while the creeks and
rivers run and while the sun, moon and stars do
shine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make you welcome to my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Altamaha stood up in his place, and with stolid
mien, looking toward his people and the whites,
began to reply, at first slowly, while his voice
grew in volume as he proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father: Listen to your children; you have
them now before you.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all belong to our great father, William
Penn; we all are children of the Great Spirit;
we walk in the same path; slake our thirst at the
same spring; and now our great father wishes
us to smoke the pipe around the same fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;Brothers: We must love each other; we must
smoke the same pipe; we must help each other;
and more than all we must love the Great Spirit;
he is for us; he will destroy our enemies, the King&#8217;s
dogs; he will make all his red children and the
children of our great father happy together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers: We are friends; we must assist
each other to bear our burdens. The blood of
many of our fathers and brothers has run like
water on the ground to satisfy the avarice of the
King. We, the red men, are threatened with
great evil; nothing will pacify the King but the
destruction of all the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the English first set foot on our grounds
they were hungry; they had no place on which
to spread their blankets or kindle their fires.
They were feeble; they could do nothing for
themselves. Our fathers commiserated their distress
and shared freely with them whatever the
Great Spirit had given his red children. They
gave them food when hungry; medicine when
sick; spread skins for them to sleep on, and
gave them ground that they might hunt and
raise corn,&mdash;Brothers: Our enemies are like
poisonous serpents; when chilled they are feeble
and harmless; but invigorate them with warmth
and they sting their benefactors to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers: Our enemies came among us feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and now that we have made them strong, they
wish to kill us or drive us back as they would
wolves and panthers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers: The King is not a friend to the
Indians. At first he only asked for lands sufficient
for a wigwam; but now nothing will satisfy him
but the whole of our hunting-grounds from the
rising to the setting sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;The King wants more than our hunting-grounds;
he wishes to kill all our old men, women
and little ones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our enemies despise and cheat the Indians;
they abuse and insult them; they do not think
the red men sufficiently good to live.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers: Who are our enemies that we
should fear them? They can not run fast, and
are good marks to shoot at; they are only men;
our fathers have killed many of them; we are
not squaws, and we will stain the earth red with
their blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers: We must compare our enemies
to a fat dog that carries its tail upon its back;
but when affrighted it drops its tail between its
legs and runs away.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Brothers: The children of our great
father Penn are different; they do not love war;
they love peace and happiness. When I heard
the voice of my great father coming up the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the mountains, calling me to this feast, it seemed
as a murmuring wind. I got up from my mat
where I sat musing, and hastened to obey it.
My pathway hither has been clear and bright.
There is not a cloud to darken it. Truly it is
a pleasant sky above our heads to-day. I have
nothing but pleasant words for my father&#8217;s
children. The raven is not waiting for his prey.
I hear no eagle cry. Come, brothers, let us go,
the feast is ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whites, at the conclusion of this burst
of native eloquence, were visibly affected. The
delivery was impassioned and clear. For the
moment all seemed to be transfixed by the impressive
character of the speech. James Greydon,
however, walked up to the savage chieftain, shook
him by the hand, saying: &#8220;Good, good, my
friend,&#8221; and then escorted him by the arm to
the tables. The whole assemblage arose and
followed in order. When the Indians were all
arranged by themselves on each side of the table,
the sachem stepped to the head and gave thanks
to the Great Spirit in loud and earnest tones
by some word of their dialect which sounded to
the European ear like &#8220;Wah, Wah,&#8221; and when
he had finished, in no less earnest tones, the
whole assembly of natives replied by words
which sounded like &#8220;Swe, Swe.&#8221; At once thereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the solemnity of the occasion was at an end.
The Indians began to talk and laugh. The feast
began.</p>

<p>In Indian fashion the natives sat on the ground
and waited for the attendants to serve them with
portions of everything on the table. The younger
people, especially the squaws, would point at
the different delicacies and dishes. One feature
which attracted the notice and remarks of the
entire deputation was a small pig, which had been
stuffed and roasted, standing on all fours. At
the other end was a large beaver, dressed and
cooked in like manner. The center was embellished
by placing a coon and a &#8217;possum, dressed
and cooked to a turn, which were standing on all
fours and facing each other, as though they were
ready to fight. These preparations of their
own popular dishes immensely pleased the Indians.
But when huge pewter mugs of cool ale were
passed, then there was fun. The old men and
warriors drank it with satisfaction. When the
young people and women were urged to take a
draught they would shrink from it at first, and
when they had tasted it they would make wry
faces at which all the others laughed. When
the cakes and pies came around, however, the
women looked at them curiously and ate them
with enjoyment, for they were produced by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
art of cookery unknown to the squaws.</p>

<p>The whole feast passed off gayly, yet modestly.
An Indian abhors familiarity and vulgarity.
The conversation was pleasant but never hilarious.
They sat on the ground, Indian fashion, and ate
with their hands and fingers, but, withal, there
was no greediness. They were polite to each other
and waited in silence for their turn to be served.
Courtesy to each other is a cardinal practice and
they respect the proprieties of intercourse between
themselves on all occasions.</p>

<p>However, in a group under a tree by themselves
were the chiefs and James Greydon and his
white friends. The whites were eating like
Indians, seated on the ground and joining in
the pleasures of the feast. When everybody
had eaten and had drunk all that was needed,
Altamaha brought out a new pipe and filled it
with tobacco from his pouch. He lighted the
tobacco with his steel and flint. After taking
several puffs of the smoke, he passed the pipe first
to the white chief, James Greydon. Then after
a few puffs, Greydon passed it to his white friends.
The pipe was then passed to all the chiefs and
sachems. After all the principal men of the
tribes had smoked the pipe of friendship and
peace, Altamaha took it to James Greydon,
saying:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>&#8220;Your brother gives you his pipe of friendship
and peace. You must keep it and never again
let it be used. Never let the fire be put out which
Altamaha has kindled for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing up, James Greydon took the pipe,
saying in reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;My good friend: The most noble of his
race is Altamaha. His pledge of friendship
to me to-day shall never be broken. The pipe
shall be a token to me and my children of the
love of Altamaha and his people. His fire shall
burn forever in my heart. But come, Altamaha,
let us all be merry. Let the young men dance.
Our white friends will be pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a sign for the dance, the great sachem,
Pisquagon, stepped out into an open space on the
lawn and began to shake his shell rattles and let
out some vocal gyrations. The young men and
women applauded by screeching and clapping
of hands. The whole concourse gathered around
Pisquagon and in unison joined in his chant:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo! ho! ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo! ho! ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo! ho! ha! ha!&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo! ho! ha! ha!&#8221; And to the rhythm made
by the shell rattles, one warrior with feathered
war-cap waving above him, shoulders and limbs
bare, lets out a whoop and starts over the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by jerking his two feet together over the ground.
Presently another, &#8220;dressed in Georgia fashion,&#8221;&mdash;little
else on than a collar and a pair of spurs,&mdash;starts
off sideways, moving his feet over the
ground by jerks, in unison with the shell rattles.
Suddenly he faces the other performer and the
two proceed in unison, one forward and the other
backward, following the same direction around
in a circle. As if by magic, yells come from the
others, and pairs join the moving circle in manner
like the first two.</p>

<p>The circle is completed. The noisy stamping
of their feet and the shrieks of enthusiasm are
startling. At certain cadences in the chant,
each one faces about and continues the moving
circle in the same direction as before, dancing
and contorting with renewed spirit and energy.
The dusky throng performs all manner of grotesque
movements. Every conceivable posture of the
human frame is kept up while moving to the
beats and rhythm of the shells. The men were
dancing alone, but a young squaw, desiring to
join, presents herself at the side of the one whom
she wishes to favor, and quietly dances in the
circle. There was no cessation of the spirit
of the dance till sheer exhaustion stopped it.
Some sort of superstitious frenzy seemed to possess
their souls. To the whites the most amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
part of it all was to observe the solemn and serious
faces of those who were in the performance of
the most grotesque antics. Not a smile softened
their somber mien.</p>

<p>A well-contested foot-race for a necklace of
beads was run between the Indian girls to conclude
the festivities, and when the setting sun had
drawn near, James Greydon&#8217;s Indian friends
had withdrawn so silently and without ceremony,
that he remarked to his guests when he looked
around to find them:</p>

<p>&#8220;The earth must have swallowed them up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Segwuna,</span> Segwuna, here are the berries,&#8221;
sang out the sweet voice of Mollie Greydon, on
a balmy June day, as two girls were seeking
wild strawberries on the banks of the Wingohocking.
The year was 1776, and the day was one
of lasting memory at Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon had invited Benjamin Franklin
and Thomas Jefferson to Dorminghurst to spend
a Sunday during the deliberations of the Continental
Congress. The change and rest in the
country would give these earnest workers the
time in which to ponder over their labors and
to consult as to measures that Congress ought
to adopt.</p>

<p>When distinguished guests were to grace the
home of the Greydons frequently Miss Mollie
was busy for days providing the table with all the
delicacies of the season, and leaving nothing undone
for the comfort of her father&#8217;s friends.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_148fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Two girls were seeking wild strawberries on the banks<br />
of the Wingohocking.</p>

<p>For the purpose of gathering a goodly supply
of wild strawberries, she went to the lodge of
Kaubequa, the mother of her favorite companion,
Segwuna, to enlist the Indian woman and her
daughter in her task. The three worked tirelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
on the day before Sunday, as the distinguished
statesmen were to be present for supper, and she
knew that wild strawberries would be such a
treat for her father&#8217;s guests.</p>



<p>Ever since the killing of Kaubequa&#8217;s brave
by the whites, when Segwuna was a small child,
this lone Indian family had made their home on
Dr. Greydon&#8217;s estate, Dorminghurst. The child
had been nurtured and educated as his own,
since she was the grandchild of Altamaha, the
great friend of James Greydon, his father.</p>

<p>The Greydons had cherished these children
of the forest as a heritage of the soil. The
family of Altamaha had always been privileged
Indians at Dorminghurst. After the death of
Altamaha, and the killing of his son in the valley of
the Monongahela, Kaubequa, her infant daughter
and boy made the long journey to Dr. Greydon&#8217;s
estate alone.</p>

<p>The white settlers had killed her brave, and
had driven her tribe from the beautiful valley
in the mountains, and the mother had wearied
of war. She knew that if she could once get to
the old friends of Altamaha she could rest
in safety and rear her two children in peace.
She oft murmured to herself in the plaintive
language of her race as she gazed upon her two
fatherless children:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>&#8220;I care not again to hear the eagle scream
on high. The war manitou has left me alone,
alone and destitute. Every day, thou, star of
my destiny, I gaze at thee. Whither shall I fly?</p>

<p>&#8220;He was still standing on a fallen tree that
had fallen into the water,&mdash;my sweetheart!</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, when I think of him! when I think
of him! It is when I think of him!&mdash;Oh, <i>disquagummee</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mind rebelled and indignation took the
place of sadness as she thought of the happy
wigwam that her warrior supplied so well with
game and fish; and how she used to enjoy the
security of their forest home. While her brave
was out after the chase, she was grinding the
corn and tanning the skins. When he journeyed
far in his favorite hunting-grounds she was cultivating
the maize and potatoes for her loved ones,
so that there would be plenty for her lord upon
his return.</p>

<p>Many times did she swing her baby girl to sleep
while her boy played about the lodge and gazed
at her with love in his young eyes as she sang:</p>

<p>But she could not, in the care of her children,
dispel the sadness of her mind, knowing that
she must give up the joys of her forest life. Everything
had been so full of hope when he was beside
her, but now she could lie on her couch of boughs
and mats and ponder upon the sad fate to which
she had been cast by the relentless white man.
Her mind oft reflected what has been well written:</p>

<p>The inevitable had come to Kaubequa, and
she sought her white friends, whose religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
abhorred war. She set up her lodge on the estate
of Dr. Greydon,&mdash;not even asking leave to do so.</p>

<p>The first evidence that the master of Dorminghurst
had of the newly arrived family, was the
presentation of a <i>mokuk</i> of maple sugar to the
household by a comely young squaw. She carried
an infant daughter on her back, bound up in an
Indian&#8217;s cradle.</p>

<p>She desired to obtain some meat, and her
way was to exchange with the white people.</p>

<p>Her son was a dextrous lad of nine years, who
had learned to fish and trap small animals for
food and fur.</p>

<p>The infant daughter of Kaubequa grew like
a young fawn around her mother&#8217;s lodge. When
the child had reached the age verging upon
womanhood, she possessed a tall, slender form,
a beautiful olive complexion and large expressive
eyes, much like the wild doe,&mdash;in that the haughty
restlessness of the wilderness child could be
discerned in her glance.</p>

<p>Her name was Segwuna, the daughter of
Springtime, and when about thirteen summers,
her mother advised her that a sign made by the
Great Spirit to her would mean that she was
to be a great woman, if she only would do whatever
her mother required of her.</p>

<p>Consequently, early one morning in mid-winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
an unusual sign appeared to Segwuna in her
dreams. She arose from her couch and ran
as far from her lodge as her strength allowed
and remained there until her mother found her.</p>

<p>Her mother knew what had happened, and
directed her to come nearer the family abode,
and instructed her to help prepare a lodge out of
the boughs of the hemlock.</p>

<p>She was told not to taste anything for two
days, not even snow. As a diversion, she was to
twist and prepare the bark of the linden into
twine. She could gather wood, build herself
a fire, lie down and keep warm.</p>

<p>Segwuna did as directed and at the end of the
two days her mother came to see her, but did
not bring a morsel to eat. Her thirst was greater
than her hunger, yet the pangs of hunger were
very violent.</p>

<p>Kaubequa sat down with her child, after she
had ascertained that nothing had passed Segwuna&#8217;s
lips for two days, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, you are my only daughter. Now,
my daughter, listen to me and try to obey. Blacken
your face and fast faithfully, so that the Master
of Life may have pity on you and me, and on us
all. Do not in the least deviate from my counsels,
and in two days more I will come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna continued to fast for two days more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
when her mother came to the lodge and melted
some snow and told her to drink the water. Her
desires were for more, but her mother would not
allow anything more to drink or anything to eat.
But she instructed Segwuna to ask the Great
Spirit to show her a vision that would not only
do them good, but also benefit mankind.</p>

<p>The night of the fifth day a voice called to
Segwuna in her slumber, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child, I pity your condition. Come, you
are called into my service on earth. I give you
my power and the life everlasting. I give you
long life on earth and skill in bringing others
to my kingdom of life everlasting in the happy
hunting-grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her vision she saw a shining path like
a silver cord and it led upward to an opening in
the sky, where stood the Great Spirit, in a brilliant
halo, encircled with glistening stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; saith the spirit, &#8220;my name is
the Bright Blue Sky. I am the veil that covers
the earth. Do not fear. You are a pure and
dutiful maiden. You have come to the limit
which mortals cannot pass. Now return. There
is a conveyance for you. Do not fear to ride on
its back, and when you get to your lodge, you
must take that which sustains the human body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna saw a snow-white bird soaring like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the frigate bird in the sky, and when she got
on its back, she was wafted through the air,&mdash;her
hair streaming behind,&mdash;and as soon as she
arrived at her lodge her vision ceased.</p>

<p>Upon awakening, Segwuna arose and returned
as fast as she could to her mother&#8217;s lodge, where
she was fed cautiously by her mother. One
could see that she had undergone a serious transformation.
The same tall willowy form and
elastic step were there, but the eyes had changed
their innocent fawn-like gaze to a tense and
determined far-away look that could be interpreted
as seriousness and reflection combined.</p>

<p>She went about her duties around the wigwam
as though some great task or burden were weighing
her down. And well might those about her observe
her changed manners, for she now deserted the
company of her former playmates and took long
and lonely walks through the deep woods,&mdash;resolving
silently to serve the Great Spirit the
rest of her life by rendering happy those whom
she loved.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit of her forefathers had now
wrought in her soul deep convictions of the duty
that she owed to her mother, her brother, and
especially to her kind young friend who lived
in the great mansion-house. The stories that
she had heard recited around the lodge&#8217;s fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of the presents made by the great white chief,
James Greydon, to her people, surged through her
mind. How kind and gentle he had always been
to the Indians! her kinsfolk! Those were happy
days before the white men had learned the beauties
of their old home on the Monongahela! All the
native traits of her race were aroused.</p>

<p>Many times she reasoned thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never forgive an injury, nor can I ever
forget hospitality and kindness. My heart bleeds
to show the King, our father across the sea,
what great wrong has been done my loved ones,
when he sent the great white birds across the
sea that caused the eagle to scream on high.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Manitou will bless his Segwuna and
teach his daughter to show the King that when
my sky was clear he ought not to send his
warlike birds on the long journey across the
water. The King&#8217;s warriors shall not prosper
on this side of the great water. Segwuna, the
handmaid of the Great Spirit, shall take her
friends over the river, across which the King&#8217;s
warriors can not pass. While her friends shall
be happy and have plenty, from this time forth
the King shall remain on the other side of the
river and wither and die, because he was so
avaricious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The small band of Indians at Dorminghurst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
learned to love and revere Segwuna. As she grew
older she stored up the herbs of the forest and
showed great skill in nursing and curing the
young and old of lesser ailments.</p>

<p>The test of the young prophetess came in the
year 1774. The severe storms and heavy snows
of the winter made game very scarce and the
Indians were near starvation. They had, therefore,
occasion to try the arts of Segwuna to determine
the range of the game.</p>

<p>So the chief of the band came into the lodge
of Segwuna&#8217;s mother and requested that her
daughter be allowed to try her skill to relieve
them. The mother laid the request before Segwuna
and gained her consent.</p>

<p>The prophetess directed the chief to build the
prophet&#8217;s lodge of ten posts or saplings, each of
different kinds of wood that she named. When
finished and tightly wound with skins, Segwuna
went inside and took a small drum and rattles
with her. The whole band assembled around.</p>

<p>The chief put the question to the prophetess:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where shall game be found?&#8221;</p>

<p>As if from some supernatural power the
drum sounded within the lodge, and a voice was
heard chanting, while the whole structure began
to shake violently, and the people without began
to shriek and moan as though to recognize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
presence of the Great Spirit that was consulted.</p>

<p>A silence fell suddenly upon the lodge, and
the people now looked for an answer to their
question.</p>

<p>A voice then arose as from the top of the lodge,
which said in slow and sepulchral tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;How short-sighted, you. If you will go in the
direction of the south, game in abundance you
will find.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day the camp was taken up, and they
all moved to the southward, led by the hunters.
Proceeding not far beyond their former hunting-grounds
a doe and two fawns were killed, and
the little band thereafter found an abundance of
food for the rest of the winter.</p>

<p>The reputation of Segwuna was thus established
among her own people, but still greater undertakings
were awaiting this handmaiden of the
Great Spirit, not alone for the good that she did
for her own people, but for the benefit of a nation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> distinguished members of the Continental
Congress reached Dorminghurst during the afternoon
when Mollie Greydon and Segwuna had
been gathering the wild strawberries for supper.
They were weary with their deliberations during
the hot June days, and the freshness of the country
air was a tonic to soul and body.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin had known Dr. Greydon since
the latter&#8217;s childhood, and he walked around
the grounds examining the garden with characteristic
good comradeship, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;William,&#8221; addressing Dr. Greydon, &#8220;are these
cherries from the trees brought over by William
Penn and planted by your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fine,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Jefferson, &#8220;are
these roses! I shall have to get some cuttings
for my garden at Monticello,&#8221; as they sauntered
along the path bordered by box, on the way
to the sun-dial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dr. Greydon to Benjamin
Franklin, &#8220;father planted the originals of most
of these trees and we have grafted the scions
to perpetuate the memory of our dear friend,
William Penn. But do you see those columbines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
on the wall? Those were brought from Monongahela
by Altamaha. That honeysuckle was
brought from England by our friend, George
Fox,&#8221; as he pointed to a beautiful vine embowering
the gate of the wall surrounding the house court.</p>

<p>The three made their way through rows of
hollyhocks, feverfew, rhododendrons, tulips,
peonies, narcissi, rows of homely bee-hives,
the spot for the physic and pot-herbs, where
pennyroyal, tansy, spearmint, anise, dill, horse-leek,
bitter-sweet, hyssop and boneset were
growing, when they reached the apple orchard
beyond the garden.</p>

<p>A large orchard seat under one of those homely
old apple trees, savoring of domesticity, brought
them to a quiet nook where the three sat down
for a discussion of affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that the delegates from Pennsylvania
will vote for a Declaration, Doctor
Franklin?&#8221; asked Mr. Jefferson of his associate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, for one, shall vote for the Declaration,&#8221;
replied Benjamin Franklin, emphatically, &#8220;but
the other delegates from Pennsylvania, Robert
Morris and James Wilson, I am convinced will
never do so. They love riches too well to disturb
present institutions. They are too close to, and
too much interested in the commercial element
of Philadelphia to be so radical. If they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
see money in the venture they would not hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you not think that they can see the
great benefits to mankind in free institutions and
in the doctrine that all men are created free and
equal?&#8221; continued Mr. Jefferson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never, sir, so long as they think that there
is any reason to stand on the argument of non-interference
with settled usage and present commercial
relations. They believe that a Declaration
would bring war and an upheaval in trade.
You know they represent great commercial
houses in London, and they think that they would
be ruined to cut off their condition of agent and
hireling. They are thoroughly whipped into line
by a policy of commercial cowardice and dependence.
They cannot see that to be independent
of England&#8217;s merchants would be for their own
benefit,&#8221; argued Franklin to his listeners&#8217; delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that they will see the error of their
way,&#8221; continued Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when they find that they are overwhelmingly
outvoted by the rest of us,&#8221; remarked
Jefferson. &#8220;But those commercial people think
that the world revolves around them and that
we farmers are mere satellites, reflecting their
wisdom,&#8221; continued Jefferson lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about the printers?&#8221; inquired
Franklin with a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, they have no right to exist, when they
print the truth about these lords of creation,&#8221;
insisted Jefferson.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they speak of themselves as men of
substance, I find that they are mighty small
potatoes, when they require a man of physic
to keep body and soul together,&#8221; happily joined
in Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, these commercial people are to be
pitied,&#8221; said Franklin. &#8220;Their glory is of short
duration. To-day they are princes of commerce,
and to-morrow they are paupers. So we must
be charitable with them and let them show how
little they know, as they usually do in a bombastic
way. Like a &#8216;tinkling cymbal&#8217; and &#8216;a sounding
brass&#8217; their glory passeth as the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time a servant announced supper,
and the three retraced their steps in jolly good
humor to the mansion, for their appetites were
unusually keen.</p>

<p>At supper Dr. Franklin exclaimed when he
tasted the wild fruit that Mollie had provided:</p>

<p>&#8220;William, where did you get such delicious
wild fruit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, our daughter, Mollie, and Segwuna,
the Indian maiden, gathered the best on the estate,&#8221;
as he indicated Miss Mollie with a gesture of his
hand, whereupon Mollie blushed inordinately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
as the two distinguished guests smiled graciously
upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I understand you to say &#8216;Segwuna&#8217;?&#8221;
asked the philosopher. &#8220;Segwuna, Segwuna,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;Why, Mr. Jefferson, we have
heard that name before. It is so peculiar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly, Doctor,&#8221; was Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s
response. &#8220;She is the mysterious Indian
maiden that has been such a constant attendant
upon our meetings of Congress. Why,
she would be at our door as we passed in, and
still there as we passed out. She has been observed
by several gentlemen. At all times she
looks eagerly into our faces as though anxious
for some sign or news that would please her.
Her face lights up with an intelligence that haunts
me ever since I first met her gaze. She seemed
so pure and noble that I have been more than
once moved at the presence of this lone Indian
girl,&mdash;the sole representative of her race among
the curious throng that have watched our deliberations.
If she lives near by,&#8221; continued the statesman
with much earnestness in his tone, &#8220;I would
like to question her, and learn her purpose at the
doors of Congress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon was surprised at this information
and he replied with lively interest:</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly may see our forest child, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Jefferson, and in fact, this very evening; for
Segwuna has grown up on our estate, and if any
honor attaches to the meeting, Dorminghurst
shall claim it,&#8221; concluded the host as he turned
to Dr. Franklin with a merry twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I take you to the lodge of Segwuna,
Mr. Jefferson?&#8221; enthusiastically questioned Miss
Mollie, as her eyes danced with joy at the mention
of her favorite companion by these distinguished
gentlemen. &#8220;Segwuna,&#8221; she added, &#8220;has told
me that great events were going to happen within
the present moon and that great leaders of men
were to come forth and proclaim the sweetest
message from the Great Spirit that human kind
had ever heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been to the meetings of Congress,&#8221;
innocently burst out Segwuna&#8217;s companion, &#8220;to
watch for what the Manitou has told her would
come to pass, because she has told me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you suppose the Indian maiden can
foretell such great matters, Miss Mollie?&#8221; asked the
venerable Dr. Franklin, who was really affected
by the enthusiasm of his young friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Franklin, there is much that is
good and wise in Segwuna. She seeks out the
poor and sick in the city and carries them medicine
and game. She says that the rich are too proud
and grasping to remember the poor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8220;She says such wise things and tells me that
her Manitou has sent her as a guiding star to me,
and that she will protect me from much danger,&#8221;
continued Miss Mollie, with a tinge of real sentiment
in her voice.</p>

<p>As the question had been answered most
interestingly by Miss Mollie, Mr. Jefferson seemed
to be seriously taken up with the philosophy of
Segwuna, and turned to Dr. Greydon suggesting
that they might go to the lodge of Segwuna and
interview her upon the glowing topics of the day
as the sage of Monticello remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;For we know not from what source we may
gather wisdom that shall illumine our path.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the meal had been finished, and the
gentlemen had relished their pipes under the
hemlocks, the whole party strolled on their way
with Mollie as leader. They took the path past
the mill on the Wingohocking and through the
wild-wood trail in the soft light of the early evening
to the lodge of Segwuna.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more peaceful or simple in
nature than the lone wigwam in a rift of the
woods, approached by a well-beaten path through
the underbrush. The curling smoke of a lazy
fire was streaming skyward in the still evening
air, with an atmosphere broken by no sound
except the barking of an Indian&#8217;s dog.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>There sat the mother on a mat before the
wigwam, and peering from the inside was Segwuna,
standing shyly out of sight, but able to perceive
the approach of the party with Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>Kaubequa sat quietly at her wigwam entrance
and when Dr. Greydon approached and greeted
her in her own tongue, she replied and smiled
as she asked Segwuna to step out and greet them.</p>

<p>As the daughter obeyed, Mollie ran and took
Segwuna by both hands, and led her toward
Dr. Franklin and Mr. Jefferson,&mdash;both of whom
bowed very low when Miss Mollie presented
her shy Indian companion.</p>

<p>As Dr. Franklin could discern serious eagerness
in Mr. Jefferson&#8217;s countenance, he volunteered
to unravel the Indian girl&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna, we have observed you at the meetings
of Congress, and may we ask why you are so much
interested in the proceedings?&#8221; asked Dr. Franklin,
when he had been presented to Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Mr. Franklin,&#8221; answered the Indian
maid, &#8220;Segwuna never misses a day. The Great
Spirit is watching every word said in Congress.
I am bound to do His bidding. He wishes
Americans to be free and make all men equal.
The Indians love liberty. The soil which the
white man has adopted for his home, in the
beginning was given by the Great Spirit to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
children, the Indians. Each Indian was to be
his own lord and master, and whoever lives on
the Indian&#8217;s land shall derive the same right.
What the Great Spirit hath given shall never
be taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mr. Jefferson had found much force in
the first answer, he nervously continued with a
question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe, Segwuna, that this land of
ours shall be free and prosperous forever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Jefferson, the Great Spirit in the
first place gave the Indians this land. He told
them that they would be given the means of
subduing all of the earth, if they would only
be industrious and cultivate the gift of corn and
make good use of His gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they did not make good use of the gift,
his white brother would come and take his birth-right
away. So, as the Indians heeded not what
the Great Spirit commanded, his white brother
has succeeded to all the good that the Indian&#8217;s
corn was intended to be for the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon was amazed at the answers
already given and thought that something more
than common knowledge was her heritage, so
he attempted a question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the Indian&#8217;s white brother to resist his
enemy, the King across the water?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Dr. Greydon, if the Great Spirit had
given this land to all men alike and all men are
to be equal in His sight no King can prosper on
the soil where Indian corn is grown; for when
the King&#8217;s soldiers eat the corn of the Great
Spirit, they shall turn upon their King and fight
for liberty like the Indian and the Indian&#8217;s white
brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Segwuna, will you tell the gentlemen
what the Great Spirit says shall come to the land
of the Indians when the King shall cease to hold
sway over it?&#8221; was the question of Mollie, who
had heard Segwuna talk about these things before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my sweetheart, I love to look upon my
native land, the land of my forefathers, as the
most powerful of the nations. But the Great
Spirit must be obeyed, or the white brother of the
Indian shall lose all like the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians have lost their beautiful land
because they did not make good use of the Great
Spirit&#8217;s gift,&mdash;the Indian corn. They left the
planting of it to the women, while they followed
the chase. But the Indian&#8217;s white brother must
make good use of this gift and become very powerful
as the Great Spirit promised. Yet when the
white man shall get too proud to eat the Indian&#8217;s
corn for food, he then also shall lose this beautiful
land.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8220;The King laughs at the Indian&#8217;s corn and
at the Indian&#8217;s skins for raiment and at the
Indian&#8217;s love for equality; but the King must
learn to give freely to his unfortunate brother.
All of this the King and his white brother must
learn from the Indian. When any one starves
in the tribe, the chief must starve also.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the King takes all of the corn away from
his hunters and gives it to the chiefs, the Great
Chief will become angry and take his corn away
from his land so that the King and his chiefs
shall have to become hunters too.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this last answer, Mr.
Jefferson stepped up to Segwuna and thanked
her for her kindness, and handed her a silver
coin.</p>

<p>But at this last act Segwuna smiled and with
polite dignity returned the coin and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Spirit hath no token of worth
except His bounteous love and kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>In return Mr. Jefferson seemed greatly pleased
as he politely shook the hand of Segwuna and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child, you have a noble spirit and
I shall remember what you have told us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other gentlemen shook the hand of Segwuna
and Mollie kissed her as they left to return to
the mansion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>On the way all turned to Dr. Franklin to learn
his opinion of the philosophy of the Indian girl.</p>

<p>After a short period of silent reflection on the
part of all, the good-humor of the old printer
could not be held in as he solemnly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the King of Great Britain does not subdue
the Americans, he shall have to acknowledge
the corn.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barclugh</span> started on his long and perilous
ride to Washington&#8217;s headquarters at Fishkill;
thence to New York.</p>

<p>He was oblivious to all that passed him on
the road. He travelled on, and on, to the ferry
at Trenton, conscious of nothing but his own
thoughts. The more that he willed to divorce
the image of Mollie Greydon from his mind,
the more his soul rebelled. He at last reasoned
that another existence than his own had entered
his life, and he could not explain the cause. But
should he only let his thoughts dwell unrestricted
on his business, at least he might be able to dismiss
her, as he had many times the existence of the
gay infatuations of his life in Paris.</p>

<p>However, her beauty of face, her form and her
carriage not only enthralled him, but he dwelt
upon the character that he found in the kindly
twinkle of her deep hazel eyes; her understanding
of the great principles of human liberty; her
patriotism; her devotion to the soldiery of her
native land. All were grand conceptions to dwell
upon.</p>

<p>In her there was no first consideration of self,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
like the frivolous woman of fashion. She knew
that a mission in life was the proper destiny for one
to follow; and in the trying needs of her country
she knew that clothes and food for the Continentals
needed her best and undivided effort.</p>

<p>She knew that every dozen of eggs, every fowl,
every blanket, every pair of woolen socks, every
yard of homespun, spoke volumes to the patient,
ill-fed, and ill-clothed Continental who was
serving for the principles of the Declaration,&mdash;serving
with no pay and expecting none. She
was happy in the pursuit of her humble mission;
she had no grievance with which to worry others.
Her mission was to render some one happy with
her deeds; consequently her life was full of elements
that daily exemplified the sweetness of her existence
to others.</p>

<p>The natural tendency of a commonplace
intellect would be to sternly rebuke others who
expressed opinions opposed to his own ambitions;
but the philosophy of human nature carried
Barclugh into deeper considerations. He had
his particular objects to accomplish and had his
plans matured to effect them; therefore, he kept
quiet about his own principles and tried to learn
every detail about the opinions of the opposition.
Thus he would be prepared to use the weak points
of his adversary to his own advantage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>He thought he knew that Colonial gentlemen
were much like their Anglo-Saxon ancestry,
honest, fearless and loyal to their convictions;
but if, after a protracted struggle, they found
their cause defeated and their case hopeless,
they would submit. Their love of peace and
tranquillity would overcome their feelings about
independence. They would be satisfied with
the forms of liberty without the substance. He
reasoned that history repeats itself among his
countrymen. When the Normans conquered the
Anglo-Saxon, his submission to the regime of
William the Conqueror was complete. He reasoned
that a decisive stroke of the English arms would
reconcile the Colonists to the helplessness of
their cause.</p>

<p>These convictions led him more seriously than
ever to conclude that the dominant party at the
end of the war would have the allegiance of
the whole country. Therefore Roderick Barclugh
was more resolute than ever to seize West Point
by means of gold and afterwards ally himself
and his fortunes to the virtues and zeal of Mollie
Greydon.</p>

<p>He travelled on the main turnpike that led
northward from Philadelphia, along the Delaware,
until he reached Bristol, which commands a
beautiful view of the river. He stopped at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
inn kept by a Mr. Benezet, and announced himself
thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Pierre La Fitte. I am a merchant
from Philadelphia, and travelling to Boston.
Have no news, am tired and hungry. Have you
provender for my horse and dinner for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord looked up in astonishment at the
brusque preclusion of prying questions as to the
business, destination and knowledge of a stranger.
Even the servants tiptoed when they came into
the presence of their august guest.</p>

<p>However, the dinner and lodging were most
excellent, and the breakfast was more than could
be expected at a country inn, but when Barclugh
paid his bill in the morning the innkeeper had
charged double prices for his guest&#8217;s exclusiveness.
As Barclugh got what he desired,&mdash;no questions,&mdash;he
did not mind the payment, but before he
had been many more days on this journey he
learned that Colonial hospitality was not always
dealt out on a money basis, and he was exceedingly
glad to change his mannerisms.</p>

<p>The refreshing sleep at the Bristol inn was
excellent to Barclugh, and the next morning
he started out with his spirits in high glee. The
enthusiasm of his nature was now working out
the possibilities of his mission, and he was calculating
the possibilities of danger in his journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
all of which acted upon him as a stimulant, while
his horse was cantering along the Delaware
road, in the fresh morning air, toward Trenton.</p>

<p>A ferry crosses the Delaware three miles below
the town, and Barclugh took it to the Jersey side
and went to an inn at Trenton that had a sign
swinging on a high post, representing a beaver
at work with his teeth, gnawing down a large tree,
underneath which was written, &#8220;Perseverando.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh was inclined to stop at the tavern to
give his horse a rest and to refresh himself while
he would be feeling his ground about his journey
northward.</p>

<p>The hour was about ten o&#8217;clock in the morning,
when the old men of the town began to gather
at the tavern for a gossip over the war news, and
to indulge in their daily allowance of rum in the
tap-room. As Barclugh dismounted and sauntered
up the steps which led into the public house,
all eyes were turned upon the stranger. He seated
himself in an arm-chair at a round table. A
large square room having a low ceiling and settles
standing at right angles to the fireplace met
his glance; the smoke was curling slowly from
smouldering logs into the chimney-space; a lazy,
fat, round-faced Swede was lolling at the end
of the bar, and several casks of wine and liquor
placed upon racks to the left of the counter were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
labelled, &#8220;Rum,&#8221; &#8220;Madeira,&#8221; &#8220;Canary,&#8221; &#8220;Cherry
Bounce,&#8221; &#8220;Perry,&#8221; and &#8220;Cider.&#8221;</p>

<p>A brace of old cronies whose only cares now
were to meet each other in the tap-room daily
and talk over the prowess among men in their
youthful days, and despair about the effeminate
youth of the present; and wonder what the world
was coming to, were seated at a table and gazed
at the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;He, he, he!&#8221; chuckled old Samuel Whitesides,
as Barclugh seated himself and ordered a hot rum
punch, for the morning air was chilly. &#8220;I declare,
those whippersnappers daown in Philadelphia
are makin&#8217; a fool aout of Ben Arnold,&mdash;he&#8217;s
got a mighty high snortin&#8217; kind of a gal
that he&#8217;s hitched up to,&mdash;and I b&#8217;leave, brother
Hopper, that he would like to be out of the clutches
of them money-grabbers. He&#8217;s too good a fighter
to be gallavantin&#8217; around in silks and satins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How queer! how queer!&#8221; squeaked out old
Jonathan Hopper, as he leaned over and poked
his old companion in the ribs. &#8220;Say, Sam, if
we were young agin like Ben, we would not
prefer to stay &#8217;round with aour wife in the city
than to be chasing those redcoats from Dan to
Beshabee, partic&#8217;larly if we had been married
less than a year, eh, Sam&#8217;l! Wall, I guess not!
He, he, he! Eh, Samuel?&#8221; as he poked old Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in the ribs again with his cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa&#8217;al, Jonathan, when we were boys, thar
was no time for this high-fa-lutin&#8217; keepin&#8217; honey-moon,
keepin&#8217; honey-moon. What we had to do
was to git married and leave Betsy at home while
we went to work to git som&#8217;thin&#8217; to keep body
and soul together. But naow, even in these
war times, our Ginerals are snoopin&#8217; araound
in these high jinks fashion, waitin&#8217; on their
leedies in taown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite keerect, quite keerect, Sam&#8217;l, but I
calcalate if you and I were to live it over agin
and had a chanc&#8217;t to git into all these doin&#8217;s that
the young sprouts now have, in the large taowns,
I b&#8217;leeve we would be as keen as ennybody for
pleesure. For what&#8217;s the use of you, you old
rascal, skrewin&#8217; yourself up into a pritty pass
over the young uns, for natur&#8217; is natur&#8217; and let
natur&#8217; take its course, Sam&#8217;l. But how queer!
how queer!&#8221; said old Jonathan as he again
poked Samuel in the ribs and took another sip
out of the rum glass.</p>

<p>By the time the pint of rum was consumed
by these relicts of the reign of Queen Anne, they
were generally ready to go up the road arm in
arm, each with a cane, just mellow enough to
show the young sprouts that nobody need show
them how to step off with the dignity of an Indian.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>However, on this day matters took a different
turn.</p>

<p>Barclugh stepped up to the old gentlemen and
inquired modestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, may I ask you the best road to
Princeton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, sir,&#8221; replied old Samuel, as he
turned toward Barclugh, leaning forward with
both hands on his walking-stick as he sat gazing
into Barclugh&#8217;s face:</p>

<p>&#8220;But have we the pleasure of the gentleman&#8217;s
name and occupation?&#8221; quizzed the old man.</p>

<p>Barclugh was not quite ready for the inquisitive
familiarity of the reply, but as he commenced
with a question there was no alternative in his
case but to answer up cheerfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Pierre La Fitte; I am a merchant
of Philadelphia on my way to Fishkill Landing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph, you got a pretty skittish ride before
you, Mr. La Fitte, and I b&#8217;leeve the longest road
is the shortest for you. You just keep right on
to Princeton and then to Morristown Heights
and when you git five miles beyond Morristown
you ask for my son-in-law, Benjamin Andrews, and
he will take good care of you and all you need
to tell him is that you met old Samuel Whitesides
and it won&#8217;t cost you a farthing for your keep.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_178fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Have we the pleasure of the gentleman&#8217;s name and<br />
occupation?&#8221; quizzed the old man.</p>

<p>However, as this conversation was proceeding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
old Jonathan kept his eye closely on the stranger
as he sat with his chin on both hands which were
resting on his cane before him.</p>




<p>Barclugh noticed that he was being scrutinized
very sharply and he did not relish his position,
but he looked out at his horse and turned to go
with a parting bow to the two old men, while he
thanked his informant twice.</p>

<p>No sooner had the stranger mounted than
the old men arose to watch him disappear up the
road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;l,&#8221; said Hopper, &#8220;what d&#8217;ye think of
that &#8217;ere stranger? I b&#8217;leeve he has no good
around these parts. He had an uneasy and
restless look in his eye. He&#8217;s got some deep-laid
business on his mind and I don&#8217;t think that was
his name that he told us. Mabbee he&#8217;s one of
those consarned British spies that we hear so
much about these times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, you got to git yourself all worked
up naow, Jonathan, and all on account of that
gentleman addressing me to the hexclusion of
yourself. If you thought that he was a spy why
didn&#8217;t you step up to him and demand his passports?
Now that he is gone you can concoct all
kinds of dreams about him; that&#8217;s cowardly,
Jonathan, that&#8217;s cowardly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam&#8217;l,&#8221; came the hot reply, &#8220;you and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
been boys and men together, but when you
impeach the bravery of an old soldier,&mdash;one who
has been at Crown Point and Ticonderogy, too!
Why, sir, that is beyond endurance, and before
I shall be seen coming down this road again with
you, may bunions like onions grow out of my
toes. I shall leave you, sir, I shall leave you,&#8221;
sputtered old Jonathan as he hobbled to his
feet, livid and glaring at Samuel with rage.</p>

<p>As he shuffled across the room with the aid
of his cane, he made for the door and straightway,
as fast as his bunions would allow him, striding
up the road, he cut the air with his hands and
cane, muttering: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned first, I&#8217;ll be
damned first.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Jonathan had not gone very far
before he met a young Indian girl going in the
opposite direction. She stopped and very quietly
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, could you tell me if you have seen a
gentleman on a black horse go along the road
this morning travelling for Fishkill to General
Washington&#8217;s headquarters? He was tall and
dark and wore a velvet waistcoat of dark blue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my girl, yes, that&#8217;s right. He was going
to Fishkill. Certainly, you just come with me,
I&#8217;ll show you a man that knows all about him.
He was just talking with him. I b&#8217;leeve that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
&#8217;ere man you ask for is a rascal, and Samuel
can&#8217;t turn my head abaout it neethur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I believe he has no good purposes
in taking this journey. I have seen him and
General Arnold meet after midnight alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that! look at that!&#8221; continued old
Jonathan. &#8220;Mabbee Sam&#8217;l won&#8217;t listen to that.
You come along with me, my girl. I want
you to show that old wiseacre a thing or two.
Come along with me, my girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they arrived at the door of the tap-room,
the Indian girl hesitated and paused at the doorway
while Jonathan bolted up to Samuel as though
he were going to eat him up.</p>

<p>But Jonathan said in his most persuasive tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Samuel, there&#8217;s a young lady here, that wants
to ask you about that gentleman on his way to
Fishkill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly, Jonathan. I&#8217;ll do anything
to please you,&#8221; returned Samuel as he rose
and went to the Indian girl, who stood at the
doorway of the tavern, as she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has this gentleman told you where he was
going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; spoke up Samuel as he straightened
to his full height to answer. &#8220;He sid he was goin&#8217;
to Feeshkill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;leeve he was lyin&#8217;,&#8221; interjected Jonathan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
with a snap in his voice. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s goin&#8217;
somewhere else and he wanted to put us off his
tracks. Now, what do you think, young lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to tell, sir, but I saw him visit
General Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;What name did he give you, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;My name is Pierre La Fitte, and
I am a merchant of Philadelphia on my way
to Feeshkill,&#8217;&#8221; replied Samuel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s not his real name,&#8221; returned
Segwuna. &#8220;His name is Roderick Barclugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at that, look at that,&#8221; said Jonathan,
glaring at Samuel. &#8220;I knew that you would be
up to great bizness when you asked that rascal
to stop at Ben Andrews&#8217;. He may be a reg&#8217;lar
cut-throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look a&#8217; here, Jonathan, I think that you&#8217;re
a-pokin&#8217; your nose too far into my way of doin&#8217;
things, d&#8217;ye hear?&#8221; ejaculated Samuel, as he
pounded on the floor with his walking-stick,
by way of emphasis.</p>

<p>Jonathan Hopper glared at Samuel as he
strode off indignantly toward the other part
of the room, while Segwuna talked to Samuel
Whitesides about Barclugh.</p>

<p>Segwuna immediately took her departure on
the road to Princeton as soon as she learned
that Barclugh had left for that direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>The two old cronies agreed that the stranger
was more mysterious after they had learned
that this Indian girl was following his footsteps.</p>

<p>For weeks afterward Uncle Sam and his friend
Jonathan had an incident of consequence to
discuss in the queer occurrences of that morning
at the inn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As Barclugh</span> mounted his steed and cantered
through Trenton, he saw happy children and
old men, chickens and ducks at every household.
Occasionally the housewife came to the side door
and gazed with arms akimbo at the strange
horse and rider.</p>

<p>There was much to occupy Barclugh&#8217;s thoughts
as he rode over this road. A little over a year
previous here the hirelings of George III laid
down their arms to the intrepid Washington,
and his mission was to overcome by means of
money what Britain&#8217;s generals had lost at arms.
The irony of the situation aroused his red blood.
He quickened the pace of his horse as the blood
surged through his body at the thoughts of the
enormity of his undertaking.</p>

<p>Quickly he left the town and turned his direction
toward Princeton. He knew that he was travelling
on martial ground. He soon came to and had
to cross the identical bridge that Washington
had so gallantly defended against Cornwallis,
whom he had sent to camp; but ere the morning,
the thunder of American artillery in the rear at
Princeton awoke the British to the fact that they
were out-generalled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Also the sleepy town of Princeton presented
its scenes of disaster to Barclugh, who was riding
along on his solitary journey of intrigue. Here
he had to pass in view of Nassau Hall, where
Washington&#8217;s force surrounded two hundred
British and compelled them to surrender. On
his way thither he had to pass over the road that
Washington&#8217;s rear-guard had so successfully
blocked to the British advance by chopping
down timber across the roadway and by burning
the bridges behind him.</p>

<p>The British representative gnashed his teeth
to actually see how helpless was the situation of
Washington&#8217;s band of barefooted patriots one
day at Trenton, and the next how triumphant
under the daring leader as he marched his little
force to safety at Morristown Heights.</p>

<p>The question never was so vividly presented
to mortal mind as now to Barclugh, to learn
the foundation for such intrepid feats in the
presence of thoroughly disciplined European
forces. Americans had no training or discipline;
so, how did they maintain such superiority with
such inferior numbers?</p>

<p>As Barclugh had not journeyed in the heart
of American territory without being wide-awake
to every bit of character, he had not forgotten
the injunction of old Samuel Whitesides to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his son-in-law, Benjamin Andrews. His home
was five miles north of Morristown. Here he
could rest and perhaps learn something.</p>

<p>North of Princeton the country begins to grow
abruptly hilly, and at Morristown veritable mountains
occur, with broad valleys stretching to the
northeast and southwest. But beyond Morristown
the country grows hard to travel through.
The ridges grow steeper, the settlers fewer, and
the timber thicker. The streams find a chance
to gurgle around the rocks and roar over the falls.
The wilderness impressed Barclugh. As his horse,
that was now jaded, carried him upon a ridge,
he stood, to take in the extensive landscape.
When ridge upon ridge met his eye the immensity
of the Colonial territory grew to a realization
upon his mind. His journey was more than a
revelation to him; it was a conviction of how
little the King&#8217;s advisers knew about the conditions
in America, while gaming around the green tables
at Brooks&#8217;.</p>

<p>Nestling among the timber in the valley of the
Whippany River was a settler&#8217;s log-house. It
stood back from the roadside and was approached
by a serpentine road, crude at present, but designed
some day to grace more pretentious grounds.
But what a pity the settler&#8217;s axe had not spared
a few of those giants of the forest, whose degradation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was evidenced by the blackened stumps of
the clearing.</p>

<p>However, the pioneer had no time to consider
anything but present utility in those days, and
as Barclugh turned his horse down the road
toward this house, he was met in the dooryard
by Benjamin Andrews, whose six feet four of
brawn and sinew had unmistakable characteristics
of force and endurance. Simplicity of life
and hard labor developed such men.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I have lodging and fodder for my horse?&#8221;
said Barclugh as he rode up to the settler. &#8220;I
have been directed to you by Mr. Samuel Whitesides,
while travelling through Trenton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I b&#8217;leeve you kin, if daddy Whitesides
sent you here. Thomas, take the gentleman&#8217;s
horse. Bless me, come in and get warm. My
Nancy will be glad to hear from daddy. What&#8217;s
the news from south&#8217;ard?&#8221; were the words of
welcome of the settler, as he led the way to the
latched door. He pulled on the string that opened
into the large room that answered for kitchen,
dining-room and sleeping-room, except for the
loft that was used by the children to sleep in.</p>

<p>As Barclugh entered the log-house, he found
Mrs. Andrews standing in the middle of the
room, shyly holding her apron, and shielding
a four-year-old boy who was holding on to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
skirt and gazing at the stranger in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nancy, this gentleman was sent to us by
daddy,&#8221; was the introduction of the stranger by
the husband, and the wife curtsied, nodding
her head as the youngster began to cry. But
no name was necessary to be mentioned so long
as he knew daddy.</p>

<p>However, Barclugh accepted the native hospitality,
and cheerfully took the chair proffered
him before the comfortable fireplace, while the
housewife went silently about her duties.</p>

<p>Benjamin Andrews had been on his farm in
the Whippany valley nearly two years, and he
had a comfortable log-house well chinked and
roofed with shakes riven out of white pine. A
good-sized log-barn, thatched with straw, six
head of cattle,&mdash;three cows and three yearlings,&mdash;one
full sow and three porkers running about
the yard,&mdash;two indifferent horses worth about
four guineas each, constituted Andrews&#8217; belongings.
His land was one hundred and eighty
acres, for which he paid forty pounds sterling,
and about thirty-five acres of which was under
tillage.</p>

<p>With willing hands, he and his family had
started in the primitive forest to make a home.
They had left the parental roof with three children
and about thirty pounds in ready money, saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
by several years of hard labor. They had two
cows and a heifer, a pair of old horses, a sow,
utensils, and a provision of flour and cider to
take to their new home.</p>

<p>That night Barclugh sat in a large arm-chair
before a blazing log fire, after he had done full
justice to a bowl of fresh milk and cornmeal mush,
also a plentiful portion of fried pork and boiled
potatoes with their jackets on. Relays of creamy
bread and rich, wholesome butter had done him
more service, after his weary journey, than a
dinner <i>à la carte</i> at the Café Rochefoucauld in his
native Paris.</p>

<p>However, what rankled in the brain of Barclugh
was the collection of so much real contentment
and the enjoyment of much comfort and plenty in
the wilderness in so short a time. Whence had it
sprung? Could one man accomplish much in so
short a period? Barclugh could not restrain his
anxiety for enlightenment. He began to ask
questions:</p>

<p>&#8220;How have you built such a fine home in
so short a time, Mr. Andrews?&#8221; were the words
addressed to the settler, who sat smoking his
pipe, while the two older children hung around
their father, gazing at the stranger from behind
their father&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, it&#8217;s ben pritty hard work, but you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
we&#8217;ve ben pritty lucky. When we fust came on
the land, nigh on to two year ago, our neighbors,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, have you neighbors, Mr. Andrews?&#8221;
interjected Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, a few, sir. After we got on to the land,
as I was sayin&#8217;, four of them came with their
oxen and axes, and in two days we hed this
here house put up and the floor hewed and the
chimney built and then in the fall they came agin,
but more on &#8217;em, and we hed a barn-raisin&#8217; and
daddy was here and we hed a rip-roarin&#8217; old time
with that barrel of cider that I kept over and that
five gallon of rum that daddy brought from taown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t it cost you anything to do all
of this?&#8221; was the inquiry of Barclugh, as he sat
listening in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a farthing, &#8217;cept the cider the boys had
and the grub. But that summer I hed raised lots
of &#8217;taters and a good piece of corn and a piece
of wheat in the clearance, the milk of the cows
kept the sow goin&#8217; and the chickens gave us lots
of eggs. Nancy here&#8221; (who stopped and smiled
at the mention of her name) &#8220;raised all those
chickens,&mdash;but the first winter I hed a close
shave on the cattle and horses, but I kinder looked
ahead for that and the spring before I found
a nat&#8217;ral medder down the river and I mowed
abaout six acres of r&#8217;al good hay and stacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it up for caow feed. That was mighty lucky,
for thet winter was hard and browsing was short
in the woods for the cattle and the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you let your stock run loose in the
winter, Mr. Andrews?&#8221; was the next interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, sir, them old pelters of horses will find
a bit o&#8217; grass if it&#8217;s kivered six inches in snow, and
two mile away. They&#8217;ll paw right through a
crust of snow for a bite of nat&#8217;ral grass. But
I keep them up at night and feed &#8217;em in the stable.
Cattle and horses do better to run out when the
weather isn&#8217;t too cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me, Mr. Andrews, how do you raise
crops among those stumps?&#8221; was the question
from Barclugh&#8217;s puzzled mind that broke the
serenity of his amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Mister,&#8217;scusin&#8217; my curiosity, but where
were you raised? I guess they didn&#8217;t know much
in them parts. For, I&#8217;d rather have &#8217;taters on
a piece of new ground. Then corn grows taller
en your head in new ground. At fust we go in and
cut out all the small trees, and girdle the big ones
so that we can go in and clear and break up the
new soil, for it&#8217;s meller and rich. Then we have
loggin&#8217;-bees when a new settler comes into the
neighborhood. In that way he gets a good boost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have to get up these bees, as you call
them? What are bees?&#8221; continued our interrogator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
who desired to make the most of his
opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that&#8217;s mighty queer you don&#8217;t know
what bees are. Why they&#8217;re very common in
these parts. But say, Mister, you must come from
some seaport town where there&#8217;s no sich things.
I guess you&#8217;re mighty green ennyhow, for bees
ain&#8217;t new aroun&#8217; here. Where air you from?
I hain&#8217;t seed sich a greeny in all my life,&#8221; were
the concluding words of Andrews, as he actually
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am from Philadelphia, Mr. Andrews,&#8221;
replied Barclugh, who fully appreciated the confiding
nature of the settler.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not raised thar,&#8221; continued Andrews.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not French.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I speak the language.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Mr. Franklin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I came here for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; queried Andrews. &#8220;Look at that,
Nancy,&#8221; continued Andrews, addressing his wife
who sat knitting at the table listening to the men&#8217;s
conversation. &#8220;This gentleman knows Benjamin
Franklin. How&#8217;s the French takin&#8217; up the cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re helping the Colonies,&#8221; replied
Barclugh, but continuing, in order to get at his
own line of thought, he asked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>&#8220;Do you need much money to buy these lands
and start a home in the wilderness, Mr. Andrews?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal,&#8221; replied Andrews, &#8220;as far as money is
consarned, nary a shilling have I made in two
year, but I hed some to start on,&mdash;mighty lettle
though, for I paid most on&#8217;t for the first payment
on my land, and then I&#8217;ll have to wait till I git
crops off this summer for the next payment.
But you see, we raise our livin&#8217; and the old folks
at home make us some cloth for clothes while
we&#8217;re startin&#8217;, so that by next year we can help
ourselves right along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have no use for money at home, but
you get your pay for supplies furnished Mr.
Washington, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; queried Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, that&#8217;s all well understood among our
people. When we have some pork or flour for
the army, or beef or grain, we take it to our nearest
depot and get a receipt for the stuff at the price
paid, and when it&#8217;s signed by General Washington&#8217;s
commissary that&#8217;s all the money we want
for our transactions. Our receipts will be redeemed
if Congress gains independence, and if
we fail we shall not need the receipts, for we shall
all be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>This last bit of information killed all the enthusiasm
in Barclugh&#8217;s breast, and, as he had observed
Andrews&#8217; children and wife ascend the ladder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in the corner, leading to the loft, he yawned and
began to wonder where he would sleep for the
night.</p>

<p>Andrews noticed his evident desires and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mister, I b&#8217;leeve you better turn in for the night,
and you will find your bed prepared in the corner
where Nancy and I sleep, but we allus give it
up to company,&#8221; were the parting remarks of
Barclugh&#8217;s host, who turned and climbed the
ladder into the loft.</p>

<p>Dawn was barely visible when the Andrews
household was astir. Barclugh was up first, for
he occupied the sole living-room. Then a good
breakfast was soon steaming on the table,&mdash;consisting
of fried pork, fried eggs, potatoes and
bread and butter, and bowls of milk.</p>

<p>After doing full justice to the frugal meal,
Barclugh started to prepare for departure. He
found his horse, well groomed, standing hitched
in the dooryard.</p>

<p>Going up to Mrs. Andrews, Barclugh thanked
her for such a fine bed and such wholesome
meals. He then took the little boy in his arms
and kissed him while he congratulated the mother
upon her well-behaved children.</p>

<p>As Barclugh stepped into the dooryard, he drew
a guinea from his pocket and placed it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hand of Benjamin Andrews, remarking while
he did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Andrews, you have been so kind and
considerate of me, I wish to leave you my name
and give you a small token of my appreciation
of your generous and hearty hospitality. My
name is Roderick Barclugh; I am on my way to
General Washington&#8217;s headquarters, and I hope
that I may see you again. If I can be of any
service to you, I shall gladly be at your command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Mr. Barclugh, I thought mebbee you
had some desire to not give your name, and I
couldn&#8217;t be rude enough to ask you. But you
have mistaken Benjamin Andrews, when you
offer him gold for his simple services to a friend
of General Washington. I could not and I
would not be guilty of this kind er hospitality.
You may need this money before the war is over.
I can git along fust-rate without it,&#8221; were the
words of Andrews, as he looked straight into
Barclugh&#8217;s eyes and held out the coin for its
return.</p>

<p>Barclugh reluctantly took the piece of gold
and being completely nonplussed at the sterling
qualities of his backwoods host, he grasped him
by the hand, and said with much earnestness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I honor your courtesy and your sentiments.
May we meet again so that I can return your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
kindness. I thank you.&#8221; At that the rider
turned and rode toward the gate.</p>

<p>But before Barclugh could reach the gate,
little Sammy Andrews was on foot before him,
and as the horse passed through the gate, already
opened by Sammy, Barclugh beckoned the boy
to come near him and pressed into his hand a
small buckskin wallet containing two guineas,
telling the boy at the same time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sammy, take this to your mother with the
best wishes of Mr. Barclugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy flew toward the house, as Barclugh
rode up the road, and soon disappeared over the
hill, among the timber.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Passing</span> through scenes which impressed upon
Barclugh the virtues and the hardihood of the
Colonists, he rode the whole day wondering how
such noble souls as Benjamin Andrews were to be
conquered. They were resourceful, self-reliant,
and the peer of any Englishman in gentlemanly
virtues. So long as they had no need or desire
for the artificial demands of society their character
remained absolutely unassailable. But in the
cities, where luxury and old-world customs were
imbued, there the power of money would be felt,
and only there.</p>

<p>However, after six days of travel, the suborner
of American character had had several good-sized
shocks to his theories, and one of these
was the fact that one hundred years ago or less,
the ground over which he had travelled had been
an unbroken wilderness, and now flourishing
settlements and homes were met at every turn.
What was Britain to do with four millions of earnest,
fearless people launched in a war for independence?
Oh, that the King&#8217;s advisers had known
what he had seen! They would have paused
and considered the demands of their people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
across the sea.</p>

<p>Such reveries were suddenly to cease, however,
for passing out of New Jersey on the mountain
road, Barclugh had passed into the confines of
Ulster County, New York, when he was abruptly
confronted by three armed men. He had been
walking ahead and leading his horse after a long
day&#8217;s travel and had no thoughts of war:</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! Friend? or foe? Advance and give the
countersign,&#8221; thundered out the leader of the
three.</p>

<p>As Barclugh looked up he saw three gun-barrels
levelled at him, and not losing his nerve replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend! I will present my passport.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passport was the one from Arnold, commandant
at Philadelphia. It ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Philadelphia, May 20, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Commander of American Outposts:</p>

<p>&#8220;The bearer of this passport, Mr. Pierre
La Fitte, will be granted safe convoy and allowed
to pass American outposts on his way to Fishkill.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has important business with the Commander-in-Chief,
General Washington.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) B. Arnold.<br />
&#8220;Major-General &amp; Com. at Phil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well, Mr. La Fitte,&#8221; came from the leader.
&#8220;I spose you&#8217;re from the south&#8217;ard, and what
news is there, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>&#8220;No news, sir. What is the shortest road to
Fishkill?&#8221; was the impatient answer of Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Methinks,&#8221; rejoined the leader, &#8220;that you
are in a mighty haste. What be your profession,
stranger?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing himself up to his full height, Barclugh
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a financier.&#8221; Hoping thus to overawe
the rustic soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, a financier, a financier, eh? Wal, you
are the fust one that ever struck these parts. I
guess you are too rare a bird to be travelling among
our folks for no pains. I b&#8217;leeve we better pick
your feathers a little and see what kinder skin
you got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, if we scratch his skin we might find
a Tartar, eh?&#8221; said the eldest of the three, and
the other two laughed at his wit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I b&#8217;leeve if he&#8217;s a fi-an-cee man he oughter
have a lackey or two along to black his boots,&#8221;
said the second soldier as he nudged the leader
in the ribs, &#8220;and powder his hair. Ha! ha! ha!
Eh? boys?&#8221; continued the latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, you will be punished for these
indignities, when I report you,&#8221; spoke up Barclugh,
threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Mr. Feet, we know who is boss
in this &#8217;ere neck of the mountains, and we&#8217;ll apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
first American principles to your case. I b&#8217;leeve
the majority rules in this taown meetin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say this feller is Mr. La Blackleg, and oughter
peel off for a little inwestergation,&mdash;and all of
those in favor of that motion will say &#8216;<i>aye</i>&#8217;!&#8221;
Up went three hands and a mighty &#8220;<i>aye</i>&#8221; in
unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carried,&#8221; yelled the leader.</p>

<p>Then the three laid strong hands on Barclugh.</p>

<p>Resistance seemed in vain for Barclugh, and
he submitted, since he had prepared for just
such an emergency. He was calm, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I am perfectly agreed you should
examine all of my papers, and take me to your
headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh took off his coat and handed it over;
then he took off his brace of pistols, boots, socks
and hat.</p>

<p>There were but two papers in his coat,&mdash;one
the passport of Arnold, and another which the
leader read, who then danced around in high
glee, holding the letter high up in the air and
shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yi! yi! yi! We&#8217;ve got him, boys! Nary
a bit of honest bizness are these fiancee men up
to. How be it, he may be in-cog-ni-to, but
I b&#8217;leeve he&#8217;s pritty nigh to findin&#8217; out he&#8217;s in
the wrong bizness for this country. Listen to this:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>As read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Philadelphia, May 20, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir:</p>

<p>&#8220;I take pleasure to recommend to your kindly
consideration, Mr. Roderick Barclugh, who is a
gentleman of substance and of good parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is on a secret mission for me to New York,
to learn of the arrival of some important treasure
ships of the English, and also to assist in our
mutual business of privateering.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is traveling <i>incognito</i> and if you can further
him on his journey, our common cause will be
very materially assisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;With every sentiment of esteem and regard,
I am, dear General,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Your most obedient servant,<br />
&#8220;(Signed) R. FitzMaurice.</p>

<p>&#8220;To His Excellency, General Washington.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I told you! I told you!&#8221; said the leader, &#8220;he
calls himself Mr. La Fitte, and here&#8217;s Mr. Barclugh
on a secret mission to New York about some
treasure ships. I wonder if he has any treasure
aboard naow. Boys, you jest peel off that feller&#8217;s
clothes a little more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other two went at Barclugh with surprising
energy, and examined every seam of his clothing,
and brought off a buckskin belt that was around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
his waist, and the three went at its contents.</p>

<p>First they brought off fifty gold pieces, English
guineas.</p>

<p>Then they felt some papers in a small pocket
and lo, here were bills of exchange on the Bank
of Amsterdam for eighty thousand pounds in gold.</p>

<p>The leader held the bills up and counted three
each for twenty thousand pounds and two each
for ten thousand pounds, and then turning to
his companions, said seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;That beats my reckonin&#8217;. Boys, this fellow
is an infernal rascal, for he has more money on
his person than any one man can honestly earn.
Say, Mr. Feet, where did you git this treasure?
Did you earn it? Did you find it? Does it
belong to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; replied Barclugh, &#8220;if you will
conduct me to the camp of General Washington,
I will present you with the guineas I have and
any reasonable reward you may ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary a guinea will an American soldier ask
from a stranger to perform his duty. You will
be conducted safely, with every guinea you have,
to Captain Thomas Storm and he will turn you
over to Colonel Abraham Brinkerhoff, who has
command of our precinct,&#8221; were the soldierly
words of the spokesman of the party as he continued:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>&#8220;Fall in, boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>They now took up the march in silence, leading
the horse which carried their prisoner, bootless
and sockless, on the saddle.</p>

<p>Their journey led Barclugh to Newburg, the
headquarters of Colonel Brinkerhoff, who at once
ordered the important prisoner with his papers
to the headquarters of General Washington.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief received the papers
and went at once to his office, whither Roderick
Barclugh had been conducted, and very graciously
returned the bills and gold after reading the
letter from R. FitzMaurice, the financier, with
no remark except:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, Mr. Barclugh, that you were
handled so roughly yesterday by our outpost,
but you will understand that they have orders
to stop all travellers and search everybody that
they do not know personally. The road is much
used by the Tories and British going to and from
Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Colonel Hamilton has told me that
he has met you at dinner at Mr. FitzMaurice&#8217;s
and we would be pleased to have you stop over
night with us. Our fare is plain, but we shall
be pleased to make you as comfortable as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take great pleasure in accepting your
kind offer, General, yet I shall be compelled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
be away soon in the morning, since my business
is urgent,&#8221; replied Barclugh as he looked squarely
into the eyes of General Washington in order to
drink in every word that this great and good man
uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be at your own pleasure, Mr.
Barclugh. Colonel Hamilton will furnish you
passports.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please excuse me further at present; Colonel
Hamilton will be here to take you to our quarters.
I will see you later on,&#8221; were the simple words
of the Commander, as he left Barclugh and
mounted his Virginia-bred horse for a review
of a new battalion from Connecticut.</p>

<p>The town of Fishkill was one of those sleepy
little settlements during the Revolutionary War,
nestling in the shadow of a high promontory
projecting into the Hudson. However, in a
military way it was of great importance, since
the great highway between New England and
the Western States crossed the Hudson here; and
an important depot of supplies was maintained
there to furnish the needs of the northern army.
The prison, strongly palisaded, the workshops for
casting shot and cannon and the mills for making
powder were maintained at this convenient spot.</p>

<p>The headquarters of General Washington and
his staff while on a tour of inspection were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
assigned to one of the commodious farmhouses
of the time on the highroad skirting the Hudson
north of Fishkill. Washington and his military
family were finely quartered. A short distance
from the activities of the camp stood the commodious
Colonial residence of Colonel Hay, on high
ground overlooking a most wonderful scope
of surrounding country. There was Newburg
across the broad river; Storm King and Crow&#8217;s
Nest loomed up in the vision out of the Hudson;
and tier upon tier of the hazy blue Catskills rose
in the northwest to soothe a soul&#8217;s longing for
enchantment.</p>

<p>While seated in a tent on the grounds of the
mansion, and while musing on the scene that lay
before him, Barclugh was approached by the
urbane and talented Colonel Hamilton, who
escorted him to the house.</p>

<p>There Colonel Tilghman, one of the aides,
was met. He conversed most delightfully with
Barclugh for an hour or more, until dinner was
spread and the General had arrived.</p>

<p>With the General came Generals Knox and
Wayne to dine, and after a short presentation and exchange
of compliments they all sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>The repast was simple,&mdash;served in the English
fashion, eight or ten dishes filled with meat,
poultry and vegetables, placed on the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
followed by a course of pastry. After this, the
cloth was removed and apples and nuts in profusion
were served. They were eaten during toasting
and calm conversation. The General was very
fond of this after-dinner intercourse, and prolonged
it sometimes for two hours.</p>

<p>Barclugh now had the opportunity of his whole
journey,&mdash;to observe the caliber of the men who
held the fate of the Colonies in their hands.
He was amazed at the bearing and conversation
of Washington and his military family. The
dignity and the ease with which they made one
feel at his best, still, the reserve used, the high tone
of the sentiments expressed, commanded not only
respect but esteem for Washington and his cause.</p>

<p>The Commander conversed pleasantly with
Barclugh,&mdash;but to penetrate the General&#8217;s business
or to divine his plans was to attempt the impossible.
There was a certain point to which one could
approach in Washington&#8217;s confidence, but beyond
that arose a barrier which no one could essay to
surmount.</p>

<p>Such a feeling of remorse arose within Barclugh
that his previous intentions of setting forth the
virtues of Arnold waned and he could not muster
the moral force to open upon Arnold&#8217;s assignment
to West Point, unless the General asked
about Arnold himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>However, at eight o&#8217;clock Barclugh was summoned
from his room to supper after the English
custom.</p>

<p>The supper was simple also. It consisted of
three or four light dishes, some fruit and above
all a great abundance of nuts, which were as well
received as at dinner.</p>

<p>After Washington, his military attaches and
Barclugh had partaken of this light repast, the
cloth was removed and a few bottles of claret
and Madeira were placed on the table.</p>

<p>The toasts this evening were given by Colonel
Hamilton, who was particular to mention several
of the belles of Philadelphia, whom Barclugh
had met. When it came the turn of Barclugh to
propose a sentiment or a toast, he asked them,
gracefully, to drink to the welfare and happiness
of Miss Greydon of Dorminghurst, all of which
was well received by those present.</p>

<p>Exactly at ten o&#8217;clock the members of the
General&#8217;s staff presented themselves to Mr.
Barclugh, and after customary formalities retired
gracefully for the night, and left the General
alone with his guest.</p>

<p>Washington filled the glass of Barclugh and
then his own and while nibbling a few kernels
of hickory nuts he said to his guest:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you left France, Mr. Barclugh, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
you think that the French monarch would maintain
an army for our cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no question about it, General
Washington. Mr. Franklin told me as much
when the full effects of Burgoyne&#8217;s surrender and
the failure of Cornwallis and Howe to hold
Philadelphia were realized. The French monarch
was then encouraged to throw all of his resources
against England,&#8221; replied Barclugh, hoping to
put Washington off his guard, and have him grow
enthusiastic for his cause.</p>

<p>But Barclugh was to be disappointed in this
result. Washington again asked him a leading
question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, do you believe that the British
can use heroic measures to offset the French aid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, General. The British will be sure
to exert themselves more than ever in that event.
You know that the British have a great navy and
great resources of money. When the power
of money is put in the balance, the weaker force
will have to succumb. That is the manner in
which the Britons argue,&#8221; contended Barclugh,
as he looked intently at Washington, waiting for
his reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied the patriot patiently, &#8220;if the
English reason that way, they forget that men
have souls. Here is a nation of four million souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
waging war against the most powerful of monarchs,
and no money of our own. We came to America
because we had no money; the nobility had control
of it. We have built up a nation without money.
However, we shall defend it without the Englishman&#8217;s
money. Our people take the quartermaster&#8217;s
receipts as eagerly as they would British
sovereigns, and they pass current for all dues,
because we have grown up in the confidence of
mutual helpfulness. Destroy that confidence and
the Englishman&#8217;s guinea becomes mere dross.
If a ship were loaded with gold and human beings,
in case of distress, the Englishman would
sacrifice the human beings to save the gold,
whereas the American would throw overboard
the gold to save the human beings.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when a soldier fights on the battlefield
simply to gain gold, he begins to think which is
more valuable, life or gold, and he loses confidence
in the gold; but when a soldier fights on a battlefield
for civil or religious liberty, he becomes
reckless of life and is willing to sacrifice all for
liberty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir, we fear not the war of gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, General,&#8221; argued Barclugh, &#8220;will not
the commercial classes and the men of wealth
be influenced by considerations of Britain&#8217;s gold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men of large wealth are already Tories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Mr. Barclugh, and against us. The commercial
classes will be on whichever side their trade is
encouraged. But the great mass of Colonists
are agriculturists, whose virtue is above reproach
and on whose hardihood and honesty of purpose
this nation must place its reliance. If they stand
firm and fight for the principles of our Declaration
of Independence, this nation shall never perish,
but if they allow artificial allurements of gold to
buy their liberty, then we shall have expedience
for our principles and laughter at our pretensions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh saw that principles had firm root in
the Commander&#8217;s mind, but he thought that he
would sound for any petty prejudice that might
be lurking in his heart, so he cunningly said:</p>

<p>&#8220;However, you know, General Washington,
that a great many Philadelphians seem to be
ambitious after wealth. I have noticed some
lukewarmness for the cause there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon Washington at once began to get
reserved and continued the conversation by
asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, have you any news of General
Arnold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the last time I met General Arnold,
he complained about the great social demands
upon him, and that to meet his expenses he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was driven almost to distraction. I could think
that this good man might be ruined in Philadelphia,
by too much gayety. Then you know,
General, that he was never before used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief did not express an
opinion about Arnold, but Barclugh observed
that very careful mental note was made on what
was said of Arnold. However, he continued by
asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have completed your mission in
New York, how do you propose to return, Mr.
Barclugh? I shall be pleased to serve you.
I presume your mission is entirely of a business
nature and you will fight shy of the military
people,&#8221; in his most gracious and pleasing manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to return by way of the Jerseys, General.
However, I may not be able to return at all.&#8221;
Desiring to impress upon Washington the seriousness
of his intentions, these were the concluding
remarks of Barclugh&#8217;s important conversation.</p>

<p>After the exchange of a few civilities about
Philadelphia people and the exchange of mutual
compliments for the pleasant evening spent together,
Roderick Barclugh arose and retired to
his bed, determined to start early in the morning
for New York,&mdash;a journey of sixty miles.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At sunrise,</span> the next morning after the conversation
with Washington, Roderick Barclugh
started with his passport signed by Colonel
Hamilton. He took up his journey on the road
that leads south through the highlands on the
east side of the Hudson to New York.</p>

<p>From Fishkill the road is hemmed in on both
sides by steep hills. Glimpses of the river are
obtained occasionally as a traveller reaches some
vantage-point. An hour&#8217;s ride brought Barclugh
to a view of a broad stretch of the Hudson, and
there lay before him the object of all his travels
and labors,&mdash;West Point in full view.</p>

<p>He leaped off his horse eagerly, and fastened
him to a sapling. Then with spying-glass in
hand, he found a seat which, in a commanding
position on a high cliff, overlooked the scene
like an amphitheatre below him.</p>

<p>Proceeding to sketch the redoubts, approaches
and armament of West Point, Barclugh admired
the location as a military stronghold and thought
as he critically surveyed the situation:</p>

<p>&#8220;If that palladium of liberty can be assaulted
and won with gold, General Washington may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
then admit that gold is mightier than either
the sword or pen.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he stood in thrilling admiration of
this wonderful work of engineering skill which
had been built by a nation that the English King
had been wont to call barbarous. Here, frowning
with cannon, were works that had risen out of
a desert in less than two years, and which would
have cost the English government five hundred
thousand pounds sterling, but they had been built
by Americans who did not expect pay.</p>

<p>Immediately above West Point the Hudson
flows through two precipitous headlands almost
face to face,&mdash;one upon the east and the other upon
the west bank. After passing these two promontories
the river makes a quick turn to the
eastward, and then to the southward, thus forming
a short bend and then stretching out into a straight
reach of several miles.</p>

<p>On the point of land thus projecting into the
bend of the river, six redoubts were bristling
with cannon. They were located in the form
of an amphitheatre, beginning at the lowest ground
and extending to the highest summits. As the
river here is surrounded by mountains, the construction
was planned so that one redoubt commanded
the next lower and also the river both
up and down stream. A chain was stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
across the channel to stop ships of war. Two
lofty heights opposite West Point protected the
eastern bank with frowning cannon that overlooked
the whole valley. One hundred and fifty cannon
were counted by Barclugh in these strongholds,
and a goodly part of them were the spoils of the
American victory over Burgoyne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he to succeed in his plans to cause the
downfall of such a military position?&#8221; recurred
to his mind as he sought his horse and nervously
turned his steps to the highway. There were
now only fifty miles of a journey to King&#8217;s Bridge,
the first British outpost.</p>

<p>His plans seemed to be working admirably,
and he was thanking his luck that he had travelled
thus far and no mishaps to block his game had
occurred. As his horse galloped nearer the British
position his hopes mounted higher, and he saw
visions of the future, where he would be emulated
for his part in the subjugation of the rebellious
Colonists. Surely they would be better off under
the protection of the powerful mother country
than to pursue the mad career of independence.
His reverie was suddenly brought to a termination
when he came to a fork in the road where the
question as to the wisest course to follow had to
be determined.</p>

<p>The roads fork below West Point, and form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
two parallel routes to New York,&mdash;one following
close to the Hudson, and the other, five miles
back, taking the same direction. Barclugh had
to rely on his chart and on his own judgment,&mdash;he
thought the back road would be less frequented
and consequently more to his liking,&mdash;so he chose
the back road.</p>

<p>Everything went along serenely this day with
Barclugh. He passed the last American outpost
by simply presenting his passport from Colonel
Hamilton and entered the neutral territory infested
by roving bands of &#8220;cow-boys,&#8221; and &#8220;skinners,&#8221;
as they were termed.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Croton River near sundown,
Barclugh stopped at an inn kept by a Connecticut
dame, whose husband, it was learned afterward,
had gone to war to escape death at home from
the length of his wife&#8217;s tongue.</p>

<p>When Barclugh arrived in sight of the inn he
had visions of a square meal; for his ride since
sunrise had aroused the demands of nature.
But as he dismounted, somewhat of a surprise
awaited him at the doorsteps in the person of a
smallish woman, having a weazened face, a short,
whittled-off nose, little, steel-blue eyes and a large
mouth. The lips were thin, colorless and compressed
in such a manner that no man dared
to dispute her ability to bear down and insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
upon her own, sweet way.</p>

<p>Without any preliminaries the woman commenced
at Barclugh as soon as she saw him
approach:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t b&#8217;leeve I can care for any strangers.
Are you from the eastward? All my rooms are
full. If I keep you at all I shall have to give up
my own bed. Dunno what to do. Have you
ready money or orders? If you have ready
money I might take you, but I would have to
charge you more. Are you a stranger in these
parts? The next inn? Oh, that is thirteen miles
beyond. You couldn&#8217;t reach it to-night. If you
did, you would not like it anyway. The people
there haven&#8217;t any family tree. Have I anything
to eat? Oh, yes, but I wasn&#8217;t brought up to do
this kind of work. Since Joshua went to the
war I have had to wash the dishes and I am
spoiling my hands. You are from Paris, eh?
I always did like to entertain real gentlemen.
I like Frenchmen, too; they are so polite&mdash;I
suppose you are hungry. It&#8217;s La Fitte? Why
that&#8217;s real aristocratic. My maiden name was
Hopper. I was born in Haddam, old Haddam
in Connecticut. My father was selectman in
that town for forty years, and he was deacon
nigh on to the same. &#8217;Pears to me I used to know
some French people. Yes, their name was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
lemme see&mdash;oh, yes, they could not have been
any kin of yours. Their name was La,&mdash;La
Porte. If I had only known that I was going to
have a real gentleman to-night from Paris, I
might had a nice chicken and some ham and
eggs.&mdash;You are a financier, eh? Oh, that&#8217;s
real nice. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;re married? No? Well,
how delighted I am that you have come this way;
come right in. You know I haven&#8217;t heard from
Joshua for nigh on to two years&mdash;the poor man
may be dead. Have I any children? Oh, no,
Joshua and I always thought we ought to have
had one and we were going to call him little
Eli,&#8221; was the introduction Barclugh had to the
Red Squirrel Inn presided over by Mrs. Charity
Puffer.</p>

<p>Being put on his guard by the first onslaught,
but concluding that she was harmless, Barclugh
determined to learn more of the American phenomenon
before his departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puffer led her guest to the sitting-room,
flew up stairs, told her cook that a gentleman of
quality was there for supper, put on a clean dress,
spread a clean table-cloth, flew out to have a
chicken killed, brought out a couple of pieces
of silver that used to be in Deacon Hopper&#8217;s
family and then came in and sat down before her
guest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Every moment of talk that was wasted in getting
supper ready seemed an irretrievable loss to her
existence,&mdash;especially when she had some one
on whom to ply her vocation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that I would make a smart
wife for a nice rich man?&#8221; she began again.
&#8220;This life in the country nearly kills me. You
know I never had to live this way before I married
Mr. Puffer. He brought me out here and I
have had to work my fingernails off. Don&#8217;t
you see how poor I am? I was a beautiful
young woman and he couldn&#8217;t furnish me any
servants. I worked and worked, for I was so
industrious. What was he doing all this time?
Poor man, he was laid up with a disorder like a
fever, and I had to nurse him and care for him.
Then he got discouraged. Well, I couldn&#8217;t
teach him anything. He was so obstinate.&mdash;He
wouldn&#8217;t dress himself up like I wanted and
I had the hardest time to get him to take me
to meeting.&mdash;He didn&#8217;t want to wear gloves,
so I used to say to him: &#8216;Father, you must try
and look nice,&#8217; and he would say: &#8216;Jest so,
Charity.&#8217; He would hold his hands and arms
straight down by his sides and his fingers out
stiff when I put gloves on him. Well, I used to
get so provoked, because he knew better than
that. When I used to say: &#8216;Father, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
let your hands hang kind o&#8217; natural,&#8217; he would
say: &#8216;Jest so, Charity.&#8217; Well, I want to tell
you, when the war broke out I just made up my
mind that father had to go to war or I would go
myself. So he went one day, when I hit him
with the boot-jack, and I haven&#8217;t seen him since.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, supper will be ready in a very short
time. It takes so long for supper to cook when
the fire don&#8217;t burn. Did I ever have any beaux?
Yes, I was forgetting to tell you about a beau
I once had, when I was a gay and young woman.
His name was Nehemiah, and he used to come
around before I knew Joshua. Well, Nehemiah
came one evening to see me and I was not in good
humor at all. After the old folks had left us to
spark a little, I moved over to one end of the
settle, and when Nehemiah moved toward me,
I sat up as stiff as a stake and I turned my back
on him and never spoke once to him that whole
evening. Well, at last when I wouldn&#8217;t speak
or stir, he got skeered and I haven&#8217;t seen his
face from that day to this. Well, I must tell
you, Mr. La,&mdash;LaFeet, I don&#8217;t like men anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I perceive you don&#8217;t, nor anything
to eat either,&#8221; chuckled Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you see it is such a pleasure for
me to converse with a gentleman that understands
my better qualities and can appreciate the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that he comes into the environment of a refined
and well-bred lady. You know that there are
so many inn-keepers who are vulgar. They
haven&#8217;t any china that has been in the family
for two generations,&mdash;no plate, nor manners.
My sakes! I have been forgetting all about
supper with my stories,&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About yourself,&#8221; interjected Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest so, Mr. Feet. I&#8217;ll go out and see if
Betty has the supper on the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Puffer disappeared, Barclugh
drew a long breath and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! whew! I&#8217;ll have a time to get something
to eat here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! what do you think, Mr. Feet? Supper
has been ready a long time. My Betty can cook
a chicken, boil a ham and make tea quicker
than anybody I ever knew. Come right along
this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit down with you and I know you will
enjoy your supper. Will you be seated right
there? Here is some chicken. I never eat any
meat for supper, myself, before going to bed.
I drink my cup of tea. Oh, can&#8217;t you cut the
chicken? Oh, that&#8217;s too bad. Just sharpen
the knife a little. That&#8217;s it. Just put a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
muscle into it.&mdash;Well, I declare, Betty just half
boiled that chicken. If you can wait a little
I shall take it out and boil it a little more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Mrs. Puffer,&#8221; said Barclugh,
as he sat down out of breath, after he had stood
up to carve the fowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s some bread and butter, Mr. Feet. I
do enjoy Betty&#8217;s bread and butter. It&#8217;s about
all I care to take for my supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, is that some ham, on the other
side of the table?&#8221; queried Barclugh, as he saw
that he would have to take matters into his own
hands, if he were to have any supper.</p>

<p>For the first time, Mrs. Puffer looked embarrassed,
as she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is one of those celebrated hams
that are cured in Connecticut. It came from
old Haddam, and it is well seasoned. Yes, my
father used to cure those hams fifty years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that one, I hope, Mrs. Puffer?&#8221; helplessly
queried Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not that one, Mr. Feet, but he used
to cure them just like that.&mdash;Will you have some
more tea? There&#8217;s plenty of tea. Oh, yes,
I knew you would. Just one drop of milk and
I wonder if Betty put on enough sugar? Well,
you can excuse the sugar this time. There, I
told Betty to cook you some eggs, but she has
forgotten. I know that you wouldn&#8217;t care for
any ham if you didn&#8217;t have eggs to eat with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
You will have some more bread and butter, I
know you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam, if you please, I will take some
of that ham also, and make myself a sandwich,&#8221;
insisted Barclugh, for matters were desperate
for his stomach&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Feet. I will take it over to
the sideboard, and prepare you one, myself,&#8221;
was the offer of Mrs. Puffer, expecting her guest
to say: &#8220;No, thank you, it will be too much
bother.&#8221;</p>

<p>But not that way for Barclugh. He arose
from the table and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Allow me to assist you. I will take it over
to the sideboard for you,&#8221; wishing to be agreeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No! you mustn&#8217;t do that! I couldn&#8217;t
allow you! I will do that myself,&#8221; interposed
Mrs. Puffer, as she jumped up hastily and grabbed
the platter to take the ham off the table, when the
so-called ham rolled to the floor and bounced up
like a rubber ball, for it was as hollow as a fiddle,
and made of wood.</p>

<p>Barclugh simply sat back and laughed till he
was tired out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puffer picked up the wayward morsel
and placed it on the sideboard.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_222fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Barclugh simply sat back and laughed till he was tired out.</p>

<p>She sat down as coolly as though she had used
the ham before, and broke the silence by saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. La Fitte, you know how it is when you
have to trust to servants. I have that dish of
ham for an ornament on the sideboard, but Betty
had to place it on the table this evening. That
is just like those girls. They do not know better.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was nothing for Barclugh to do now
but to eat bread and butter, and fill up on tea and
talk.</p>

<p>When a man is disappointed in his meal he
begins to get ugly. So Barclugh arose from the
table, went into the sitting-room and demanded
his bill and declared that he would have to leave
for the next stopping-place.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Puffer objected, by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. La Fitte, you know that these
roads are infested with &#8216;cow-boys&#8217; and &#8216;skinners,&#8217;
and you may be captured and robbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which party is it that you belong to, Mrs.
Puffer?&#8221; asked Barclugh. &#8220;I should think that
you belonged to the latter.&#8221;</p>

<p>From without the house loud shouts of &#8220;Hello!&#8221;
&#8220;Hello!&#8221; were heard on the road.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puffer turned to Barclugh exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of those rascals are there now. You
better hide yourself somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, madam,&#8221; replied Barclugh,
and handing over a sovereign to pay his fare,
continued, &#8220;I can take care of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>At that instant a burly fellow in the uniform
of a Continental walked in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any strangers here to-night, Mrs. Puffer?&#8221;
came in heavy tones from the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one gentleman here, Mr. La Fitte.
I believe he can give a good account of himself,&#8221;
replied the landlady.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your business here, Mr. La Fitte?
Where are you going?&#8221; demanded the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my passport, sir,&#8221; was the reply, and
Barclugh handed out the Colonel&#8217;s document.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the sort of a party we want!&#8221; remarked
the fellow, as he went to the door and whistled,
meanwhile holding his pistol ready and eying
Barclugh.</p>

<p>Four of his companions came into the room,
and at once the spokesman ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fasten his arms, men. He&#8217;s a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh submitted while wondering why his
passport was not sufficient.</p>

<p>After the squad had searched Barclugh and
disarmed him, they marched him out and ordered
him to mount his horse and ride between them.</p>

<p>However, when the troopers started off their
course led them to the southward. They acted
queerly to Barclugh. They crossed the Croton
at Pine Bridge and went toward the Hudson.
In any event he was all right unless the scamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
were bent on robbery. However, he did not
lose his nerve. Finally, after an hour&#8217;s ride and
silence, the prisoner ventured this question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I am a prisoner in the hands
of which party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a prisoner of His Majesty King
George III. No talking, sir, we are on dangerous
ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh&#8217;s spirits at once mounted high. As
soon as he reached a British post, he would
despatch a cipher message to General Clinton
in New York and he knew that at once he would
be escorted to secret quarters in the town.</p>

<p>To understand Barclugh&#8217;s perilous position
in the country through which he was now passing,
a few facts concerning the conditions existing
in the spring of 1780 must be stated.</p>

<p>From the upper part of Manhattan Island or
King&#8217;s Bridge to the Croton River was neutral
ground, during the British occupancy of New
York. The British sent out reconnoitering
parties toward the American lines and the Americans
would reconnoitre toward the British. Independent
bands of Tories called &#8220;cow-boys&#8221;
raided into this territory, and foraged upon the
inhabitants who did not sign allegiance to the
King. Then the American bands called &#8220;skinners&#8221;
raided upon the loyalists. The real warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
of these parts consisted in these lawless bands
watching each other when on raids and if the
&#8220;cow-boys&#8221; had a good drove of animals, the
&#8220;skinners&#8221; attempted to disperse the band and
appropriate the spoils. The whole of the lower
part of Westchester County was thus kept in
distress during nearly all of the Revolutionary
War by the ravages of these bands.</p>

<p>On the night in question, when Barclugh was
a prisoner in the hands of his friends, the party
was ascending a steep hill in silence and surrounded
by dense forest, when suddenly out of the night
air and darkness rang a voice within a hundred
feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Surrender, you devils!&#8221; and the clicking of a
dozen flintlocks sounded in quick succession.</p>

<p>At the sound of such a number of clicks, the
five British whirled on their horses and dashed
down the hill and Barclugh did as the rest, but
he was in the rear since he did not understand
their tactics of retreat.</p>

<p>A volley followed the foe, retreating in the dark.
Barclugh&#8217;s horse was shot, and threw his rider
headlong with such violence that he was stunned
and rendered unconscious. One of the fleeing
British dropped his flintlock in the fracas.</p>

<p>The attacking party chased the fleeing British,
yelling and exchanging pistol shots. They returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
when sure that the &#8220;cow-boys&#8221; were out
of harm&#8217;s way and picked up the unconscious
form of Barclugh. He was still unconscious
when placed against a tree next to the roadside.</p>

<p>After being administered a good drink of rum,
Barclugh opened his eyes and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, where am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a prisoner,&#8221; replied the leader.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a prisoner,&#8221; insisted Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still one,&#8221; came the sharp reply.</p>

<p>A fire had been lighted by this time and all
were warming their fingers in the chilly air of
the May night.</p>

<p>Barclugh gazed around and noticed that all
wore the red coats of the British. He realized
that he might better be good-natured over his
captivity. He turned to his captors, with the
remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I have been a prisoner twice
since sundown,&mdash;once the prisoner of King George
by a party in Continental uniform, and now a
prisoner a second time by a party of redcoats.
Please inform me whose prisoner I may be now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did they git you?&#8221; asked the leader.
&#8220;Did they git you in that Red Squirrel Inn?&#8221;
at which the whole party laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;leeve he tried to git a piece of that wooden
ham,&#8221; sung out one of the party, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
another burst of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you cut that chicken?&#8221; repeated another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I gave up the chicken as
a bad job, broke the ham, paid Mrs. Puffer a
sovereign and got no change, being glad to escape
alive; for she told me she had hit Joshua with a
boot-jack,&#8221; at which recital the whole party
roared and some of the younger fellows rolled
on the ground in delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she tell you how beautiful she used to be
and how she froze out Nehemiah?&#8221; was the
next question that gave them all a chance to laugh
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, and she asked me if I &#8216;didn&#8217;t
think she would make a smart wife for a nice
rich man?&#8217; but I didn&#8217;t get a chance for a word
in edgewise for an answer,&#8221; related Barclugh
to the intense delight of the whole party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, stranger, I guess you are a purty good
fellow. Where did you come from and where
are you going?&#8221; asked the leader of Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came from the headquarters of General
Washington this morning and gave my passport
to those scamps and now they have carried it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, if you are able to travel we will take
you to General Washington&#8217;s headquarters right
away; for you are a prisoner of the Westchester
Independents, and General Washington is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Verplancks Point to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh was not much the worse for his mishap,
except that his shoulder was strained and he was
bruised on the side of his face where he had slid
down the hill.</p>

<p>He procured a new horse, proceeded to headquarters
under the escort of two troopers, and
being recognized by Colonel Hamilton, proceeded
on his journey next morning.</p>

<p>He rode through the American lines by way
of Tarrytown and was not molested by either party
until he surrendered himself to the sentinel
of King George at King&#8217;s Bridge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Barclugh arrived at King&#8217;s Bridge, the
time was midnight, and as he was muffled and
his name was assumed he had little risk of meeting
any person who would suspect his business.</p>

<p>He informed the sentinel that he must see the
officer of the guard at once.</p>

<p>Upon the officer coming to the guard house,
Barclugh requested that a note be sent without
delay to General Clinton, the British Commander,
as information of the first importance must be
sent to headquarters.</p>

<p>So the officer despatched a horseman to the
Beekman House at full speed with the following
note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;King&#8217;s Bridge, May 28, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir: I have the honor to announce my arrival
at King&#8217;s Bridge. I must be conducted to a
safe retreat at once. My plans have carried
but I am very much battered by travel and narrow
escapes.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) Pierre La Fitte.</p>

<p>&#8220;To General Clinton,<br />
<span class="gap">&#8220;Commander of H. M. Forces in America.</span><br />
<span class="gap2">&#8220;Beekman House.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>Within three hours Major Andre arrived alone
with an extra horse at Fort Knypthausen, the
defense at King&#8217;s Bridge, and after a few subdued
words with the officer of the guard, Barclugh
was hurried to a horse. His former animal was
turned loose on the road to find its way back
to Verplancks Point. Thus no trace of Barclugh
could be followed on account of the horse that he
had ridden.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken by Andre to Barclugh
in the guard house. Andre ordered the officer
to release the stranger. The officer told Barclugh
that he was to leave the guard house and follow
Major Andre until the horses were found, and
to not speak until well out of hearing.</p>

<p>After Andre had travelled a few hundred yards
away from Fort Knypthausen, Major Andre
grasped Barclugh by the hand and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, I am glad to see you. How
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am nearly dead, Major Andre,&#8221; replied
Barclugh, &#8220;I have been captured and made
prisoner three times. I was fired on last night
and my horse was killed. But after a hard
journey, I am here with my plans working.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arnold is committed to treason. I have
the plans and strength of West Point, and a great
amount of information for the Commissioners.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>&#8220;Grand! Magnificent!!&#8221; exclaimed Andre.
&#8220;We need a stroke like this to arouse the nation,
and counteract the French coalition with America.
I am devoted to your plan. I believe patents
of nobility and grants of land are the only means
that will subdue the Americans. Of course,
results must first be brought about by the judicious
use of gold to gain the leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; continued Andre
gaily. &#8220;How is my friend, Mrs. Arnold? We
used to have such gay times while in Philadelphia.
Does she not sympathize with our social life?
I have heard that after our evacuation of Philadelphia,
the event was celebrated by a grand ball
given by the Whig element, but, when it came
to a list of those who should be invited, enough
belles could not be found unless the Tories were
included. So the whole list of ladies that attended
our grand heraldic pageant, the Mischianza,
had to be invited to be present to have a success.
The Shippens, the Chews, the Bonds, the Redmans,
the Willings and the whole list of our friends were
there. Any of the ladies of the first circles who
will not stand for the principles of aristocracy
is a <i>rara avis</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you forget, Major Andre,&#8221; argued Barclugh,
&#8220;that when you do find such a lady, you
will have a gem of the finest brilliancy. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
a one will be a Whig out of principle, whereas
a woman becomes a Tory out of sentiment,&#8221;
as he recalled the argument between Mollie
Greydon and Mrs. Arnold at the dinner party
at Robert FitzMaurice&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Andre&#8217;s quarters were reached after the exchange
of many pleasantries, and the soldier showed
the financier a room and bed and gave the key
to Barclugh to guard himself against any intrusion.
Barclugh was now safely quartered where he
could carry out his business with the utmost
secrecy.</p>

<p>The remainder of that night and the next
day were spent in bed by Barclugh. He was
suffering severely from the fall off of his horse,
the night before his arrival.</p>

<p>Major Andre had meals brought to his own
room, and then quietly carried the meals to Barclugh
himself.</p>

<p>After two days and two nights of rest and
nursing and a supply of clean linen, Barclugh
was sufficiently recovered to be escorted, in the
dead of the night,&mdash;when nothing was astir in
the old Dutch town but the solitary sentinel&mdash;to
the Beekman mansion, the present location
of 52nd Street and Broadway. Here were the
quarters of General Clinton.</p>

<p>Major Andre had his permanent quarters at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
No. 1 Broadway, and when he and Barclugh
walked out of the rear of these quarters a chaise
and postillion were ready for the financier and
his escort to be driven in haste to General Clinton.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Clinton, the Commander of the
British forces in North America, spent much of
his time at his country house, the former mansion
of Dr. Beekman, and on the night in question
he was anxiously waiting to greet Roderick
Barclugh.</p>

<p>His career had been unfruitful of results in
America thus far, as he had failed to aid Burgoyne,
and, after evacuating Philadelphia, and retreating
by land to New York, had suffered disaster at
Monmouth; he had failed in his attack on Fort
Moultrie, and now his whole career was centered
upon the capture of West Point by intrigue.</p>

<p>Seated in one of the upper chambers of the
Beekman house were Sir Henry Clinton, the
Commander, Lord Carlisle and William Eden,
M. P., Commissioners of the British government
to America.</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle was the life-long friend of George
Selwyn,&mdash;the wag of English society and court
circles in London at this time. William Eden,
a mere figure-head and courtier, was the intimate
friend and political supporter of both Carlisle
and Selwyn. Charles Fox was the brains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
political force for this entire coterie, so that the
presence of Carlisle in America on his mission
is obvious, since Fox was irretrievably in debt
to Carlisle and Selwyn. Furthermore, Fox had
been the associate of Carlisle at Eton and they
had grown up to be inseparable cronies; both were
involved in all the noted gambling escapades at
Brooks&#8217; and Almack&#8217;s for the previous ten years.</p>

<p>Besides the Commander and the two Commissioners,
the room contained a large round table
and a sideboard well supplied with Madeira
and claret. This chamber was used for councils
of war by General Clinton. A map of the thirteen
Colonies and the seaboard was lying carelessly
on the table. Carlisle and Clinton were discussing
the losses at the gaming table the night before
and Eden was snuggling up to a newly-opened
bottle of Madeira, while seated in a large arm-chair,
enjoying a pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>Barclugh entered the room, following Major
Andre, and was received by the three very, very
cordially, but with much formality, as they had
met on serious business.</p>

<p>Here were five men authorized to treat with
the Colonists in any manner that would win
them back to the allegiance of the King. They
could wage war, confiscate property, starve prisoners,
offer rewards for treason, offer to concede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
every demand of the Colonies for their political
welfare except independence. The utmost desire
of the Commissioners was to effect some compromise
with the leaders of the revolution and preserve
allegiance to the mother country.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh was a very important personage
in this council. He had done important
service in Paris for the financial interests of the
English government, and was now working out
plans to stop the war for the benefit of England&#8217;s
Exchequer, so that, whatever he said had much
weight.</p>

<p>They all listened most intently to the recital
of his advent into Philadelphia&#8217;s commercial
circles,&mdash;because he had much capital at his
command. How he became acquainted with
the weakness of Arnold, through the oyster
vender, Sven Svenson, and how he interested
Arnold in privateering enterprises, all was heard
with much interest. Then the final surrender
of Arnold to the proposition of treason, for twenty
thousand pounds sterling and a brigadier&#8217;s
commission in the British army, was received with
profound satisfaction.</p>

<p>When Barclugh told of his journey, his being
captured three times and his interview with
Washington, they listened with wonder; but when
he told of the experience with the Connecticut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
dame at the Red Squirrel Inn and the wooden
ham, the whole party laughed long and heartily.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the narrative, Barclugh
turned to General Clinton and said brusquely:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Clinton, Arnold has been paid part
of his price, and I shall turn the military end
of the business over to you. He will get his
assignment to West Point and you must carry
out the details of the plans already entered into.
He will correspond with you under an assumed
name, and his language will have the <i>entente</i>
of carrying out some large commercial transactions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, the conception and execution
of your plans have been magnificent, and I shall
entrust the fulfilment of them to my able, young
adjutant, Major Andre,&#8221; graciously assented
General Clinton, as he turned with beaming
eyes and countenance to his staff officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, gentlemen,&#8221; continued Barclugh, &#8220;my
task at Philadelphia is but commenced. My
desires are to finish my business here as soon as
possible and return to start my next enterprise.
I have the people and plans engaged to start
a bank in this country. It is to be known as the
Bank of North America. The model is to be
our Bank of England, and we shall have the
government of this country so closely allied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with this institution that only safe measures of
legislation will be allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our great obstacle in overcoming the rebellion
in our Colonies is the lack of any centralizing
power to draw all the men of substance into one
party and the poor devils into another. The
reason is that there are no organizations to control
the accumulation of property.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life and industry create property, and money
has been sanctioned by custom to represent
property; but an artificial system can be established
to control money; therefore, whoever controls
the money of a nation controls its life and industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commissary receipts answer as well for money
now as gold, but if we have a corporation of leading
men of substance who lose their individual
interests in the policy of the bank, why, we can
issue a dictum that gold only will be received
as money; then the vital interests of thousands
at once are merged into the centralized body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me establish a bank in Philadelphia,
and I shall lay the foundations of a rich man&#8217;s
party that will bring the Colonists to the institutions
of the mother country more effectually than
armies or navies ever can.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the armies will conquer and hold the valley
of the Hudson, and if the military will conquer
and hold the southern provinces, the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
money will take Philadelphia with no loss of life.
Then the Americans will tire of the war and be
glad to surrender to the fair offers of His Majesty&#8217;s
Commissioners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle rubbed his hands with an excited
air of satisfaction and said enthusiastically:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, you have outlined the whole
matter. Nothing more is necessary. Eden and
I are mere figureheads here, waiting for a decisive
blow, so that we can ply our vocation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The army must act now on your initiative
and the results are sure to be forthcoming,&#8221;
continued Carlisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; proposed Lord Carlisle, as he
arose with his glass partly filled with Madeira,
&#8220;success to Mr. Barclugh and his enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all drank their Madeira, standing, in
honor of Barclugh.</p>

<p>The financier arose after the compliment paid
to him and said modestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I thank you for your expression of
regard.&#8221; Then, raising his glass he continued:
&#8220;My best wishes for a speedy conclusion of war
between Great Britain and her Colonies on constitutional
grounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentiment was received heartily by the
others, and with glasses raised high all drank
deeply as only Englishmen can drink,&mdash;with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
&#8220;heel-taps.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conference being over, General Clinton
took Barclugh by the arm and escorted him to
another room for his arrangements to return to
Philadelphia. The other three remained in the
council chamber, to see that King George, the
aristocracy and British sordidness, were well
remembered with innumerable glasses of Madeira.</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle and William Eden were ordinary
representatives of English hangers-on to royalty&#8217;s
apron strings. Both were fat and lymphatic. No
enterprise thrilled their souls. They were more
than pleased to accept the established order of
their condition so long as the government was
good,&mdash;to them and theirs. They were as pliable
as putty in the hands of the controlling influence
of the monarchy. They wanted a fat living
out of government with little service in return.</p>

<p>William Eden had his hobby, especially when
a chance to tell it over his Madeira offered.
Filling his glass, and turning to Carlisle, he
stupidly rehearsed his theories:</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord, you know I have very decided
policy in regard to subduing the King&#8217;s enemies.
(By Jove, that&#8217;s good Madeira.)</p>

<p>&#8220;To make it the interest of Congress to close
with us (the King&#8217;s Commissioners) will be of the
first consequence. (How&#8217;s that, Andre?)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8220;Well, from the many conversations which I have
held with the men of substance here in New York
and from the nature of things, you know that
we ought to propose a scheme of government
(My Lord, a government as is a government),
by a Parliament in the Colonies, composed of
an order of nobles or patricians,&mdash;and a lower
house of delegates from the different Colonial
assemblies,&mdash;to be given to the provinces upon
their return to allegiance to our King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it, Eden, allegiance is what we
want,&#8221; interjected Carlisle, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Another glass of Madeira and Eden laboriously
gathered up his avoirdupois and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;That form of government would have a general
influence upon the minds of those who now
possess authority in America, as their present
precarious power would be by this means secured
to themselves and handed down to their descendants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the idea all right, Mr. Eden,&#8221; said
Carlisle, as he slyly winked at Andre, &#8220;but we
must have some others to listen to us than these
bottles of Madeira and Major Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Eden,&#8221; continued Carlisle, &#8220;let&#8217;s have
one glass to the words of Dr. Johnson:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That patriotism is the first business of scoundrels.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>After this last appeal to Bacchus for inspiration,
these two pillars of British statesmanship found
that they needed the assistance of Major Andre
to help them to their bed-chambers.</p>

<p>While the commissioners were exchanging
empty platitudes, and drinking the wine furnished
by the Crown, the real business of the evening
was being concluded between General Clinton
and Barclugh. As soon as General Clinton had
led the way to an airy bed-chamber Barclugh
began to unfold his plans:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Clinton, I must not delay here one
minute longer than necessary, for Washington
has this town filled with spies, and my detection
here, at this house, means disaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to return to Philadelphia?&#8221;
asked General Clinton.</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan,&#8221; replied Barclugh concisely, &#8220;is
to return as far as possible by water. I wish
that you could put me aboard one of your small
armed cruisers and send me down into one of
those numerous inlets that are opposite Philadelphia
on the Jersey coast. I can be furnished a
small boat, and in case of capture I can pretend to
have escaped from an English vessel. In any
event I shall be taken to Philadelphia and turned
over to Arnold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an excellent plan, Barclugh, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
have just the man to perform the task,&#8221; said
Clinton, &#8220;Captain Sutherland of the Sloop Albatross.
I shall send for him at once, and
have you secreted on board to-night, and then
you can rest from your former journey. I
know that Washington&#8217;s spies are among us, and
that you must be spirited away or you will surely
be traced to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the two were waiting for Captain Sutherland,
for whom an order had been despatched
to report at the Beekman house for duty orders,
Barclugh went over the details for the fruition
of Arnold&#8217;s plot. The correspondence was to
be conducted between Barclugh and Major
Andre. Barclugh would sign as Gustavus; Andre
would reply as John Anderson. Barclugh would
turn over his letters to Arnold so that no traces
could be found for detection. As Barclugh was
known among his commercial associates to be
in touch with merchants in New York, he could
correspond with little suspicion.</p>

<p>When Captain Sutherland was announced in
the office below, General Clinton brightened up
and arose as he addressed his associate:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, Mr. Barclugh, have you all of
your effects ready to depart? I dislike to have
you leave us so informally, but duty calls and
there we are.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m ever ready,&#8221; was Barclugh&#8217;s prompt
reply. &#8220;My whole wardrobe and effects are on
my person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland was ordered to proceed
down the coast of Jersey, and land his passenger
on the Jersey coast opposite Philadelphia, but
in no case to sacrifice the safety of the passenger.
Obey the passenger as to the place and manner
of landing, and in no case to let his presence
on the ship be known. Not even Captain Sutherland
could be informed as to the business or name
of Barclugh; he was simply introduced as Mr.
Gustavus.</p>

<p>The Captain of the Albatross and Barclugh
mounted their horses and proceeded to Paules&#8217;
Hook landing in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>When Barclugh and his companion had reached
the landing and were walking briskly to the ship&#8217;s
boat, out of the darkness came the figure of a
female, who walked up to the two and touched
Barclugh on the arm.</p>

<p>Barclugh stopped in amazement and looked
upon the creature inquiringly, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;My good woman, what can I do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, sir,&#8221; sweetly replied the mysterious
woman, &#8220;I was looking for my brother who
was coming down to the ferry, and I thought
that you were he,&#8221; she continued in the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of a well-trained Indian girl.</p>

<p>Barclugh was in a hurry to embark and did
not make any note of the incident, for he could
not clearly see the face of his questioner in the
darkness. He passed on and boarded the Albatross,
as he thought to himself, to perfect his
security.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Say, Bill,</span> if this brig gets into blue water
without a tussle I miss my reckonin&#8217;,&#8221; dryly
remarked one of the old sea-dogs to his companion,
as the two leaned on the ship&#8217;s rail next to the
cat-head. &#8220;The coast is swarming these days
with lime-juicers and if we fall into their net, we&#8217;d
wish to have our grog sent down to Davy Jones&#8217;
locker, where we&#8217;ll all be if Sammy Risk has a
thing to do with it. He&#8217;d blow us all up before
he&#8217;d strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look a&#8217; here, Hank, you old growler, if Sammy
Risk can&#8217;t show as clear a pair of heels to them
Britishers as ever vanished out of a spying-glass,&#8221;
replied old Bill Weathergage, &#8220;then I&#8217;ll take all
the jobs of slushin&#8217; and swabbin&#8217; that the boys
ought&#8217;er do for a for&#8217;night on the cruise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind what ye&#8217;re sayin&#8217;, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, you old figger-head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The privateersmen were discussing probabilities
as the Holker lay in the stream below Philadelphia
awaiting Captain Risk to fill out his complement
of sixty-five men. Roderick Barclugh had started
on his journey and the flour was all on board.
The Holker stood up like a church steeple with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
her cargo stowed away in her hold and hatches
all battened down, waiting for a passage outside
the capes. Her armament was three short six-pounders
forward, and three long nine-pounders
aft, being the batteries on port and starboard;
a long twelve-pounder bow chaser and a long
eighteen-pound quarter-deck stern chaser. A
heavy eighteen-pound swivel amidships completed
the ship&#8217;s metal.</p>

<p>She was equal to many of the King&#8217;s cruisers
in armament, and excelled two-thirds of them in
sailing qualities.</p>

<p>Word came up the river that a brace of the
King&#8217;s cruisers were standing off Cape May,
ready to pounce upon any Yankee that chanced
to run the blockade.</p>

<p>The best chance was for Captain Risk to run
the gauntlet in the dark, so that the tenth day
after Barclugh had left Philadelphia, he quietly
weighed anchor and slipped past the forts and
stood off into the roadstead, waiting for a chance
to slip out.</p>

<p>The night came on dark and boisterous, so
that word was passed to get under weigh, as the
weather looked nasty from the sou&#8217;-sou&#8217;east, and
as the enemy would have to stand off the coast
for sea-room, Captain Risk took advantage of
the opportunity to make blue water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>Setting his foresail, main and fore-topsail,
and reefing down for a scud up the coast, Captain
Risk jammed into the wind from the cover of
the river and made for the offing.</p>

<p>All lights were out and the binnacle was hooded.
A double watch was called on deck and the
Holker tacked into the teeth of the gale until
the capes were fully two hours astern. The wind
was moderating when orders came to make her
course nor&#8217;east by north. The yards were braced
in, and as the wind now came from abaft the beam,
she was bounding before the gale and scudding
from wave to wave.</p>

<p>The moon was two hours high, and was peering
through rifts in the clouds. The sea was settling
to a long swell. Every one on deck began to
feel that no danger was near, when the lookout sang
sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sail, ho.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221; asked Captain Risk, as he
stood on the port quarter, glass in one hand, and
the other on the main shrouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three miles on the lee bow. He is bearing
down on the port tack, sir,&#8221; returned the man
aloft.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well. All hands!&#8221; commanded Captain
Risk, as he turned to his lieutenant, Mr. Ripley,
saying with assurance:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&#8220;We have the weather and can keep him
guessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>All hands were called and sent to quarters
and both broadsides were loaded with grape and
round shot for close action.</p>

<p>When the enemy bore down within easy hailing
distance, he asked through his trumpet:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ship is that and where away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the Privateer Holker, sir,&#8221; replied
Captain Risk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better haul down those colors, or I&#8217;ll
blow you to smithereens,&#8221; returned the man-o-war&#8217;s
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, my hearty. Fire away, Flannagan,&#8221;
shouted Captain Risk to the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, let them have it, my lads!&#8221; commanded
the privateersman sharply.</p>

<p>The bright moonlight afforded good aim and
the execution of the broadside spread consternation
among the enemy and cut into his foreshrouds.</p>

<p>The enemy&#8217;s broadside flew high, and cut into
the Holker&#8217;s rigging as the ship rolled, with no
serious damage.</p>

<p>The Holker&#8217;s crew now braced in their yards
and shot under the stern of the enemy, who had
to come about on the starboard tack to ease
his injured shrouds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>Captain Risk now had the Englishman at his
mercy. When under full headway, he wore
ship and brought the starboard battery into
short range, thus raking the cruiser from stem
to stern.</p>

<p>Both ships were now on the starboard tack
and the Holker in the weather position. The
Englishman came up on the port tack to cross
the Holker&#8217;s bow for a rake, but the foxy Risk
brought his ship up for the port tack, too, and
filled away so fast that the broadside went astern.</p>

<p>The chance now came for Risk. The Englishman
would have to wear ship, to bring his starboard
broadside into action. As quick as a flash,
Risk came about on the starboard tack, passed
astern and raked the cruiser a second time from
stem to stern. The execution was so severe
that every one of the starboard main-shrouds
was carried away and the Englishman was
thrown into utter confusion on his deck.</p>

<p>The Holker had the Englishman so that his
only chance was to wear ship, but his masts
could not stand the strain. So the privateer
came around on the port tack and came booming
alongside, within pistol range, and delivered
another broadside of grape that cut the crew
to pieces and sent a large part of them writhing
on his deck.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>But the cruiser&#8217;s crew was plucky, for now a
running fight commenced. The Englishman got
in a telling broadside, that cut the binnacle from
under Captain Risk&#8217;s feet, and killed Mr. Ripley
at his side. The privateer, on account of her
superior sailing qualities, had to tack to bear up
to her antagonist and keep from running out of
range. The fire of the cruiser was getting nervous
and irregular and the privateer delivered a
terrific broadside that drove the men that were
splicing the shrouds, under the bulwarks. As
the Holker was closing in to board under cover
of the smoke, a voice on the privateer&#8217;s foretop
sang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Vast firing. She has struck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Risk ordered his second lieutenant
to board and find out her name and the damage
inflicted.</p>

<p>The ship was the General Monk, a brig of
two hundred tons, commanded by Lieutenant
Churchill of His Majesty&#8217;s service. She carried
sixteen long nine-pounders and two long twelve-pounders
for stern and bow chasers, with a full
complement of eighty men.</p>

<p>When the privateer&#8217;s crew boarded the General
Monk, the decks were literally strewn with dead
and wounded, and the scuppers were running
blood. The grape at short range had killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
fifteen and wounded twenty more, among whom
was Lieutenant Churchill. All the shrouds of
the foremast, and the head-sails were shot away.
The foremast and bowsprit were cut one-quarter
through. The halyards and standing rigging
were shot adrift, and the running-gear was cut
to pieces.</p>

<p>The Holker had lost the first lieutenant and
six men killed, while ten were wounded, and
much injury had been done to the sails and gear.
A prize crew of fifteen were put aboard the General
Monk, and ordered back to Philadelphia, taking
the prisoners and valuable stores found aboard.
The Holker had left, forty men effective for
service, and needed her rigging overhauled before
making for the Long Island rendezvous given
by Barclugh. So Captain Risk thought best
to put into Egg Harbor for a short time to repair
his rigging and get into ship-shape for the run
over to Long Island.</p>

<p>There seems to be a strange fatality among
ships as well as among men. In the height of
success is the period of gravest fear of the unexpected
to occur.</p>

<p>The prize crew on the General Monk were
busy setting up and splicing rigging and fishing
the spars as the prisoners were put below when
daylight stole upon the scene. The sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the guns had borne down on the other ship of
the blockade. The crew of the Holker were
tricing up stays and shrouds in order to keep
the Holker&#8217;s sticks from rolling out of her, when
about four miles, dead astern, loomed up a heavy
frigate under a cloud of canvas, making for
the scene of action.</p>

<p>Captain Risk had to be served now by his
wits rather than by his guns, for, if he took to
his heels, the prize would be left to the mercy
of the frigate.</p>

<p>Risk mounted his shrouds, trumpet in hand,
and signalled his prize to run before him on a
course opposite to the Holker&#8217;s while he ordered
deliberately, in notes clear and strong:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready, about!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mainsail haul!</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise tacks and sheets!</p>

<p>&#8220;Helm&#8217;s a-lee!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Vast bracing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doughty little captain brought his ship
over on the starboard tack, and stood into the
wind to draw off the stranger and try his speed.</p>

<p>Captain Risk now had his gear well cleared
up and the shrouds well set up to stand a run
before the ten-knot breeze.</p>

<p>With sprightly bounds the crew of the Holker
obeyed the commands:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>&#8220;Stand by main and fore-tacks!</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her pay off!</p>

<p>&#8220;Man her weather braces!</p>

<p>&#8220;Haul!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she sheered off, the ship now staggered
before the wind sooner than the Englishman
could realize the tactics of the brig.</p>

<p>The Holker had spirited away for half a mile
before the lumbering yards of the frigate could
be trimmed to meet the Yankee&#8217;s course.</p>

<p>The chase was now on, for better or for worse.
Nothing less than heroic means could save the
Holker. Her main-topsail, foresail, and fore-topsail,
were all set and she was laboring hard
under her cargo of flour; yet if Captain Risk
could hold his own until he reached Egg Harbor
Inlet, he would show the frigate, Roebuck, the
most devilish piece of Yankee seamanship this
side of Davy Jones&#8217; locker.</p>

<p>On came the Roebuck with huge wings like
a monstrous demon, yawing wildly on each crest
from the enormous stretch of her after-canvas,
but she was surely closing the gap between the
ships. In another half-hour she would be within
short range of the Holker. A chance shot might
bring down the privateer&#8217;s topmast, and then
all would be lost.</p>

<p>Captain Risk stood on the port quarter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
glass in hand, watching every rope and sail as
he turned to his men and commanded sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Man that main-stay garnet, with a luff-tackle,
bullies, and overboard cargo with a will. No
time to lose, my lads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, sir,&#8221; came from twenty throats,
as every man jumped to his station.</p>

<p>The hatches came off in a trice, and the flour
came swinging out, two barrels at a heave.</p>

<p>&#8220;No hell-hole of a British prison for us this
day,&#8221; came out from the heart of every privateersman
when he swung on the cargo with might
and main.</p>

<p>A puff of smoke now appeared out of the bow
of the Roebuck, which the crew of the Holker
watched with bated breath, until the eighteen-pound
shot fell three hundred feet astern.</p>

<p>A cheer rang from the watch on the Holker&#8217;s
deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, men, heave over the six-pounders!&#8221;
ordered the unruffled Risk. &#8220;Every inch of
free board means our bacon saved,&#8221; continued
Risk, as he stepped to the wheel and ordered
the helmsman to lighter ship.</p>

<p>Just then another puff of white smoke curled
out of the frigate&#8217;s fore bulwarks and an eighteen-pound
shot came crushing through the captain&#8217;s
cabin, and buried itself among the flour barrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in the hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is close shavin&#8217;,&#8221; said Risk dryly. &#8220;Unbend
that long tom and we&#8217;ll try that lime-juicer&#8217;s
topsail!&#8221; ordered the little captain restlessly.</p>

<p>Six of the lads on deck swung on the watch-tackle,
and the long tom was trained astern for
Captain Risk to sight a life-saving shot at the
Roebuck&#8217;s rigging. The little privateersman took
off his coat and hat and elevated the piece for a
long shot. He took a careful squint while he
signalled with either hand to haul on the side-tackles
and when the mark was sure, he ordered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gunner applied the match and the Holker
quivered as the old reliable tom dealt out its
rebuke to the Englishman. Captain Risk shaded
his eyes with both hands as he watched for the
results of his gunnery. The shot rose in parabolic
beauty of flight while instants seemed moments
to Captain Risk and his crew, but true to its
aim the eighteen-pounder cut the enemy&#8217;s fore-topsail
and yard, both of which went by the
board.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show that rapscallion that he&#8217;s not on
a pleasure cruise,&#8221; chuckled the proud Risk,
as he rubbed his little chubby hands and paced
the quarter-deck nervously. The gleam of delight
in the little skipper&#8217;s eye had no bounds, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
had saved, for a time at least, his heart&#8217;s desire,
the Holker, from humiliation.</p>

<p>Now there was excitement on the deck of the
frigate. The huge hulk yawed up into the wind
as her sails came aback after the head-sail power
was cut down, but the nimble jackies soon swarmed
aloft and cleared away the wreckage, and the other
sails were trimmed for a fresh run before the
whole-sail breeze.</p>

<p>The Holker had not yet gained security by any
means, for the captain of the Roebuck was one
of those thoroughbred English sea-dogs who had
earned his promotion from a middy&#8217;s berth to
the command of one of the fleetest ships on the
English Admiralty register. Captain Risk must
earn his safety, if he were to save his ship.</p>

<p>Yet minutes meant precious advantage to the
Holker, and while the frigate was losing headway,
the brig&#8217;s crew was heaving cargo overboard and
the privateer was leaping on the waves like a
hound as she staggered under every stitch of
canvas that she could bear. The gain on the
enemy was perceptible as each inch of free board
gave her life. She rose on the huge waves with
more ease and labored less on each crest.</p>

<p>The gale had begun to increase rather than
fall, so that when the frigate steadied up before
it once more she had her courses all set, her main-topsail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and main-topgallant sail, and the fore-topmast
stay-sail to hold her head up. A mighty
cheer went up as the frigate leaped into the wind
again in full pursuit of the brig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just give us two hours more,&#8221; said Captain
Hamilton of the Roebuck to Lieutenant Nelson,
&#8220;and we will have that devilish rebel under our
lee,&#8221; as the British commander took a long look
through his glass at the brig about five miles
ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well, sir, if we can catch him,&#8221; replied
Lieutenant Nelson. &#8220;But he seems to be making
wonderful headway and I believe those Yankees
are charmed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had one, once, point-blank under our
starboard battery on the Sir John, but the rascal
took to his heels and ran us out of sight too quickly
to tell about it. He came into the wind and shot
under our stern while we expected nothing but for
him to strike; and before we could bring our
battery to bear, we had to wear ship, so he escaped
with only a few scattering shots. Lord Ralston
cut off the grog for a fortnight to get even with
his chagrin and disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Risk now had one chance to evade the
Roebuck. That was to lighter his cargo enough
to let his ship weather the bar at Egg Harbor
Inlet. The Roebuck would then be outside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
pounding away in the deep water, waiting for
his prey to come out.</p>

<p>Extending along the Atlantic Coast from Sandy
Hook to the Gulf of Mexico, are numerous inlets
or openings between low, sandy islands back
of which is deep water and safety; but only light-draught
vessels can enter these inlets. The ebb
and flow of the tides keep a shallow channel
open, but the heavy seas of the ocean wash the
sands into a bar and the tide is not powerful
enough to cut a very deep channel.</p>

<p>One of these sand-bars was at the entrance of
Egg Harbor Inlet. A deep channel led from
behind the low-lying islands, until the outflowing
tide met the action of the sea-ways and there
formed an eddy that deposited the sands into
the bar, which was about one hundred feet wide,
and on each side of which was deep water. The
current was deflected to the southward, outside
the bar, so that the channel was like the letter &#8220;L,&#8221;
the bar being in the angle.</p>

<p>When steering into the inlet the pilot must
approach for a considerable distance, parallel
to the beach and at the critical point turn sharply
to port, or else land high and dry on as ugly a
beach as ever lured a mariner.</p>

<p>But, driven like a fox seeking cover, Captain
Risk made straight for this hole at Egg Harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Inlet. The seas were going over the bar and
breaking into foam at every wave; a mile of
breakers roared on each side of the thread-like
channel from the deep water to the sandy beach
of the islands.</p>

<p>The Roebuck was now hauling grandly into
the chase. Thirty minutes more and the Holker
would be under the batteries of a forty-four-gun
ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, lads,&#8221; remarked the little Yankee
skipper, &#8220;if you heave out that cargo with a will
and nary an eyebolt lets loose, I&#8217;ll put the Holker
into that hole yonder or we&#8217;ll pound our lives
out on the treacherous Jersey sands,&#8221; as he
stepped forward and took the wheel into his own
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands at stations!&#8221; was the last command
after guns were lashed and hatches battened
down.</p>

<p>The seas were running fearfully high from the
sou&#8217;east after the all-night gale. The breakers
could be seen for unlimited stretches right ahead,
rolling surge upon surge. The ship followed
a streak of blue water midst the white foam.</p>

<p>When the Holker struck the channel the ebb-tide
was setting out, and, instead of driving
fast ahead, the Holker seemed to hold up and
simply rise and fall on the choppy seas.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>The hearts of all were in their throats, for now
the Roebuck loomed up and everybody saw
the Englishman luff and a broadside belched forth
at the struggling Holker. Down came her main-topsail,
but as long as her head-sails hung out
she could keep before the gale, and try to weather
the bar.</p>

<p>The frigate was desperately near; another
raking broadside might take the Holker&#8217;s foremast,
and then she would be a helpless wreck
at the mercy of the breakers.</p>

<p>But the smoke hid the Holker from the frigate
for an instant, and the valiant Risk held his
ship right upon the bar. As a huge surge came
athwart the quarter to throw the brig upon the
sands, the skipper put the wheel hard up. The
ship at once broached to on the crest of a wicked
sea and rolled on her beams&#8217; ends. As the
keel scraped on the bar a burly seaman grasped
the wheel with the captain, and by wonderful
dexterity the rudder was put hard over. The
next surge saw the Holker right herself before
the wind and launch safely in the still water
beyond the bar.</p>

<p>When the Holker accomplished this daring
feat of seamanship, the crew of the Roebuck
were so thrilled that they let out a lusty cheer
for the Yankee and bore off into the blue water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to ride out the gale.</p>

<p>Now that the Holker was speeding in smooth
water to a safe anchorage, the crew were clearing
away the wreckage and admiring the little captain,
who had saved them again from the horrors
of an English prison.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Holker made the inlet at Little
Egg Harbor, she came to an anchorage behind
one of the low-lying islands. Her only chances
for an escape were a high tide and darkness, or
a fog that would let her slip out and pass the
Roebuck. If a boarding party from the English
frigate did not attack him, Captain Risk was
preparing his ship for a chance to escape. There
was much to keep his crew busy, for he had rigging
to overhaul and spars to mend.</p>

<p>At the time Roderick Barclugh was boarding
the Albatross, the Holker was waiting to escape,
and little did he think that he was to run across
the privateer. He gladly went to his bunk and
indulged in much needed rest. All he knew
was that he was to be put ashore on the New
Jersey coast near Little Egg Harbor inlet, and
then he must make his way to Philadelphia
as best he could.</p>

<p>He felt that nothing ought to worry him when
his mission to New York had been accomplished.
Thus far no drawback had occurred. Arnold
simply needed close watching and a small bait
of gold now and then to keep him working. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had arranged to sell the Holker when she had
delivered the flour, so that after the captain
and crew were paid the prize money, they could
find other adventures.</p>

<p>The Albatross was one of those small, armed
cruisers used by General Clinton to execute
raiding commissions up and down the coast.
She was of light enough draft to enter small
inlets, travel the sounds and bays, and assist
in the guerilla warfare. She was a sloop armed
with eight nine-pound carronades, and one twelve-pound
swivel. The crew numbered forty men.
As the orders given Captain Sutherland were to
convey his passenger to a harbor on the Jersey
coast, the Albatross was under way very soon,
and started tacking into the sou&#8217;east gale for the
Narrows and Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>The watch on deck was busy bringing the sloop
into stays and the men off watch were sleeping
soundly in their hammocks below decks. Barclugh
slept well until the Narrows were passed, and
the Albatross began to pound her nose into the
sea-way, then he awoke and peered out of the
cabin to see where this commotion came from.</p>

<p>Greatly refreshed, Barclugh&#8217;s mind was active
and alert. Whether the change from the shore
to the realm of Neptune had caused an undue
influence upon his affairs, only time could tell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
however, there seems to be a weak point in the
affairs of all men; as though a farmer were to
sell his land and buy a ship to go to sea; or as
though each realm of nature had deities that
rebelled upon the invasion of their particular
sphere by the patrons of the others.</p>

<p>At all events, Barclugh felt a restlessness from
the influence of the sea as he sat in the cabin
and pondered upon the working of his plot.
He now had time to think about Captain Risk
and the Holker. He wondered where she could
be and what would he do with Captain Risk,
who was the sole Colonist acquainted with his
dealings with Arnold. He reasoned thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Risk is devoted to the fickle fortunes
of privateering.&#8221; (And so he was.) &#8220;After Risk&#8217;s
present enterprise shall have been closed, he
could take another ship and probably would
be captured by a British cruiser. Thus I do
not need to fear on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neptune loves a true sailor. But when a
land-lubber enters nautical enterprises to carry
out plots, the old Sea-god sets his Nereides upon
the novice to give him a taste of wind and wave.
Only the true and tried presume to propitiate
the nymphs of Father Neptune. Neither gold
nor titles influences the Nereides of wind and
wave. The hurricane in its mighty wrath levels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the potentate to the same sphere as the peasant.
When the ship sinks, both exclaim in anguish:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, have mercy upon us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Albatross made but slow progress against
the sou&#8217;east gale. The night of the second day
she was abreast of Barnegat inlet. Before morning
Little Egg Harbor inlet was reached, but
since the moon did not rise clear after midnight,
Captain Sutherland stood on and off until daylight.
In the daytime he could make the channel
and go over the bar.</p>

<p>Early that morning the lookout forward sang
out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sail, ho!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two points on the weather bow, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland took his glass and made
out a full-rigged frigate bearing down upon him.
He had no fears, however, for he knew that the
Roebuck was in these waters, and no cruiser
of the enemy would likely be around. As the
frigate bore down alongside, within close range,
a voice from a trumpet out of the mizzen shrouds
was heard to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ship is that and where away?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland trumpeted back:</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s sloop, the Albatross, bound
for Little Egg Harbor inlet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>&#8220;All&#8217;s well,&#8221; returned the frigate. &#8220;This is His
Majesty&#8217;s man-of-war, Roebuck. We shall send
aboard important news.&#8221; The frigate came up
into the wind and lowered a boat to come aboard.</p>

<p>No sooner had the first trumpet-sound reached
the Albatross than Barclugh was up and on deck;
if he were to be captured on board an English
armed sloop, his plans would miscarry. When
he saw His Majesty&#8217;s cruiser he was reassured.
As he paced up and down the deck, he saw the
lieutenant of the frigate come aboard and go
into the cabin of the Albatross.</p>

<p>After customary formalities, Lieutenant Nelson
of the Roebuck stated his business:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sutherland, we are blockading a
Yankee privateer inside the inlet; she had captured
the General Monk; we have chased her into
this harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will attack her, we will send you a
full complement of men. We will send the
boats and you can take her by boarding.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can not man&oelig;uvre inside the harbor,
and she is crippled. Her forward battery is
gone, and she is short of crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well, Lieutenant Nelson, I shall obey
Captain Atherton&#8217;s orders,&#8221; replied Captain
Sutherland, and then he remarked quizzically:
&#8220;Shall we appease the sea-nymphs, Lieutenant?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>&#8220;Certainly, certainly,&#8221; returned Nelson, when
he observed Captain Sutherland go to the locker
and take out a decanter of Madeira and two
long glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got your eye?&#8221; proposed Sutherland, as
the two raised their glasses, and took a long pull
at the &#8220;Milk of Venus&#8221; for the sake of good
comradeship.</p>

<p>During the day not a word could Barclugh
ask about the business of the two ships, for his
security depended upon his own counsel being
kept; but at daylight the next morning, there
was no more question in his mind.</p>

<p>Lying at anchor behind the island was a crippled
brig with main-topmast gone. The frigate
was lying a mile on the weather bow, and all
was activity on her decks. Three boats&#8217; crews
were boarding the small boats; he saw them
strike out for the Albatross. The wind had now
settled to a steady breeze from the south.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Nelson was in command of the
boats&#8217; crews from the frigate, and as they came
alongside, sixty brawny men, armed to the teeth,
mounted the deck of the sloop. With the boats
in tow, the Albatross now made over the bar
toward the Holker.</p>

<p>When the Holker escaped the Roebuck and
weathered the bar, Captain Risk commenced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
once to replace the injured topmast, and get his
sails repaired so that he could slip out in the
dark of night, and show his heels to the frigate.
But when Risk saw the armed sloop make the
inlet with the three boats in tow, he knew what
was ahead for his crew; therefore, he called them
all on deck and pointing to the sloop, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Men, there come those lime-juicers to take
this brig. They outnumber us two to one. Shall
we make them pay for their pains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; came from every throat, and the
boatswain stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, wherever you lead us we will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Risk was now on his mettle. His
ship was crippled; his main-topmast was gone,
he had thrown overboard his six-pounders, and
he was short his two lieutenants; his prize crew
was on the General Monk, and the killed and
wounded in the engagement depleted his numbers;
however, he was determined that if he were compelled
to strike to the enemy he would make
them pay two for one.</p>

<p>Mounting the quarter-deck, he first ordered
a spring-line on his kedge to windward, his bower
anchor to leeward so that he could spring his
stern in a semicircle and bring his battery of
twelve-pounders to bear, no matter from what
point the enemy approached.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>Next he ordered the boarding-nets in place,
loaded all the muskets and pistols, and placed
everything handy for fighting close aboard. Cutlasses
and pikes were made ready and the deck
was sanded. The battery was double-shotted
with grape for close execution.</p>

<p>The Albatross came up with a fair breeze from
the south&#8217;ard as though they were on a pleasure
excursion. When the sloop drew up into the
inlet, Barclugh got the glass from Captain Sutherland
and critically examined the lines and rig
of the Holker.</p>

<p>He then began to think. The whole matter
came before his view. The Holker could be taken.
The crew and Captain Risk could be confined
until his plot was carried through. Yet he did
not wish any harm to come to Risk during the
fight.</p>

<p>When Barclugh returned the spying-glass to
Captain Sutherland, he remarked earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sutherland, I see that fellow is getting
ready to give us a warm reception, and may I
have the honor of leading one of your boats&#8217; crews
against him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the captain imperatively.
&#8220;I have strict orders to land you safely on the
Jersey shore in Little Egg River, and I can not
take any risks. You better repair at once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
your cabin, and remain there during the engagement,
sir,&#8221; continued the captain, as he turned
to order his men. Barclugh could say nothing
to these orders, and he went below to mingle
with the crew of the frigate.</p>

<p>Among the men he noticed a good-natured
looking fellow; going up to him, he said in an
undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you, my good man. Kindly
come to my cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221; replied the man-o&#8217;-war&#8217;s man,
as he ambled along with Barclugh.</p>

<p>When they reached his cabin, Barclugh said:</p>

<p>&#8220;For certain private reasons, I desire to go
aboard that brig when she is taken. Here are
five guineas, my man, if you exchange your
uniform for my suit. You remain closely in
my cabin and keep the door fastened until I
return. Give me your name and station and I
will take your place in the boarding party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is William Atkinson, hand as
hit&#8217;s to obleege a gentleman I&#8217;m willin&#8217;. We &#8217;ave
more&#8217;n this business than a poor man&#8217;s pay
allows. Hi belongs to boat&#8217;s crew number one,&#8221;
replied the sailor as he hitched up his trousers
and put the guineas in a bag around his neck.</p>

<p>When Barclugh had changed his garb, Atkinson
looked at him and remarked:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>&#8220;Keep in the dark and go along with the rest.
Hin the hexcitement you will not be knownst.
Howsomever, you better get a little grease to
blacken &#8217;em hup a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh took his place among the armed men
below, and kept in the dark corners until the
command was passed to man cutter number one.</p>

<p>As the sloop boomed up with a spanking
breeze, every available space was occupied by
the one hundred armed men on her decks, so
that they looked like black birds. Captain Risk
did not intend to remain idle while this array
was coming on. Instead, he trained his long
eighteen-pound pivot, and opened the fracas by
giving the Englishman a good shot between wind
and water.</p>

<p>The sloop then manned the cutters and while
they were advancing on the brig, the sloop luffed
up and delivered a broadside at long range,
but most of the shot fell short.</p>

<p>However, four boats&#8217; crews, three from the
frigate and one from the sloop, advanced on the
Holker with loud cheers. Barclugh took his
place unnoticed; the frigate&#8217;s men thought a man
from the sloop had gotten into their crew by
mistake. The spy was intent on gaining the
deck of the Holker so that he might protect Risk
if possible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>As the four boats&#8217; crews came up to the Holker&#8217;s
bow within close range, Captain Risk swung off
on the kedge-spring line, and brought his broadside
up to the boats and a sheet of flame burst
out of the Holker&#8217;s side. A score of men lay
prostrate on the bottom of the boats. Barclugh
escaped.</p>

<p>The boats opened up a hot fire and took different
courses,&mdash;one to the forward chains,&mdash;one
on each quarter, and one astern.</p>

<p>The boat&#8217;s crew astern cut the spring-line on
the kedge, but that only let the Holker drift with
the wind.</p>

<p>Now commenced the fight with small arms,
when the cannon could not bear. The crew
of the Holker stationed themselves on the forecastle
and on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>A rush was made by the attacking party at
the forward chains, but every time a head showed
itself above the bulwarks, it was met with a
cutlass or marlin-spike.</p>

<p>Two different rushes were made by the British
at the stern, but each attack was repulsed, and
after forty minutes of ineffectual work the
English boats retired amidst loud cheers from
the Holker&#8217;s crew.</p>

<p>The English lost fifteen killed and twenty
wounded. They went back to the sloop severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
crippled,&mdash;so much so, in fact, that signals were
at once made to the Roebuck, and two boat-loads
of crippled and dead sent off to the frigate.</p>

<p>That evening Captain Risk saw four boat-loads
come back from the frigate to the sloop. He knew
that he was to have a night attack from more men
than before, and he had lost six men in the fight
that day. His force was now reduced to thirty-four
men.</p>

<p>Risk prepared for an emergency by placing
his long tom amidships so that if the enemy
gained the deck forward or aft, he could turn
them a point-blank charge of grape, and, with
a rally of his men, drive them overboard.</p>

<p>As Captain Risk expected, however, at midnight
he could see six boat-loads approaching in the
moonlight. He stationed his men, and they
knew that before Captain Risk would strike to
the enemy he would apply a match to the magazine,
so every man determined to die at his station.</p>

<p>As soon as the enemy&#8217;s boats were distinguishable
in their dim outlines, a rapid discharge of
the twelve-pounders and the muskets began. The
English separated and dashed forward. The
plan was well executed, since almost at once the
six boats came alongside at different points.</p>




<p>Fighting like demons, the crews of the boats
were determined to avenge the day&#8217;s repulse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
gain the deck. The English were driven back
amidships and astern where Captain Risk led
his men; but in the forward chains the English
were in such numbers that they clambered up
so fast that the Yankees were driven back.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_274fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Captain Risk engaged two seamen, cutlass in one hand<br />
and pistol in the other.</p>

<p>When Captain Risk saw the English gathering
for a rush from the forecastle, he grabbed a match
and turning the long tom forward, he applied
the fire. He then called his men to his side
to drive the English back into their boats.</p>

<p>But the English had too many. When the
long tom dealt its carnage, enough remained
to rush upon Risk and his little band, where a
hand-to-hand encounter ensued.</p>

<p>Rushing at the head of his men into the fight,
Captain Risk engaged two seamen, and with
cutlass in one hand and pistol in the other, he
shot one through the shoulder and sent the other
reeling to the deck with a cutlass stroke on his
head. Being now pressed on all sides, Risk
rushed with a match to the companion-way
to throw it into the magazine; but he was shot
in the forehead and killed before he could accomplish
his object. The Americans, now officerless,
were forced upon the quarter-deck; the crew
was overpowered from all sides, and the colors
hauled down by the enemy. But the victory
was dearly bought by the English. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
last encounter twenty Englishmen were killed
and thirty-two wounded.</p>

<p>Among those that were wounded was Barclugh.
When Captain Risk rushed upon the two seamen
that were advancing upon him, the one that
he shot in the shoulder was Barclugh. Faint
with the loss of blood, and stunned by the shock,
Barclugh crawled very humbly back into his
boat, and sat there until he was carried to the
sloop. He was not fatally hurt, but his arm
pained him severely.</p>

<p>When the sloop was reached, Barclugh got
aboard without the assistance of his mates, but,
once below, he crawled to his cabin door. He
found William Atkinson soundly asleep, snoring
like a porpoise blowing. When he awoke the
man-o&#8217;-war&#8217;s man, Atkinson exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217; bless me, sir, you&#8217;re shot! I was dreamin&#8217;
how&#8217;s somethin&#8217; was happenin&#8217; to you, sir. So
let me &#8217;elp you to bed and get you some water
or brandy. Here, let me get on my own clothes,
as I am sure to be blamed for these &#8217;appenin&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&mdash;off with the blouse and trousers.
I&#8217;m into them in a jiffy. You&#8217;ll be better now,
as you lie down a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Atkinson,&#8221; requested Barclugh feebly, &#8220;you
will find some brandy in the locker there,&mdash;give
me a little.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, yes, sir. I was trying a wee bit in your
absence, sir. It&#8217;s werry good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; continued the jacky. &#8220;Take
that. Now lie down sir, and I&#8217;ll go and notify
the captain, sir. But before I go, sir, I wants to
leave these guineas with you. For, as you &#8217;ad
the trouble to get shot in my place, I can&#8217;t take
your money.&#8221; But when Atkinson looked at
Barclugh, he saw that he was unconscious, so,
putting the money under the pillow, he hastened
on deck.</p>

<p>There every one was busy. Groans, curses,
the dead laid out in rows on the forecastle deck,&mdash;the
wounded placed aboard the Roebuck&#8217;s boats,&mdash;commands
for cutters&#8217; crews to man their boats,
confronted Atkinson on every hand. When his
ensign ordered the crew of Atkinson&#8217;s cutter to
give way on the oars, he was at his station, and
poor Barclugh was left unattended in his cabin.</p>

<p>Every circumstance now turned against Barclugh
and his plans.</p>

<p>Captain Risk was killed, but he had inflicted
a serious wound in the heat of battle, upon the
plotter of the scheme. Thus the fate of a nation
was in the balance.</p>

<p>The representative of British gold received
pay for his pains when he was heartlessly left
by the seaman in his cabin. When he aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
from his spell of unconsciousness, in a dazed
condition, he looked around and found himself
quite alone. After a short period of reflection,
he remembered the capture of the Holker, the
encounter with Risk and the death of the intrepid
little captain as he attempted to blow up his
ship and all on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; muttered Barclugh to himself.
&#8220;Ever since I came aboard this craft, the fates
seem to have worried me and to have been set
against my enterprise. Zounds! I had tried
to be of some service to Risk, but he has put me
in my present predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, have mercy upon me! Oh, that
shoulder is done for! I cannot raise my left
arm. I better try and call for some assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Barclugh tried to raise himself, the loss
of blood made his head light, and everything
seemed to grow dark when he raised himself.
He lay back in his berth, consoling himself
by exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better remain where I am, and thank
God that I am not worse off!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh lay quietly in his berth for hours,&mdash;in
fact until the morning after the fight. Captain
Sutherland had thought of Barclugh as fast
asleep, little thinking that his passenger would
disobey orders. However, when Captain Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
had left a crew aboard the Holker to fit
her out and take her to New York, he began to
look after his passenger. Not finding him astir
and nobody having seen him for twenty-four
hours, he went to Barclugh&#8217;s stateroom and
rapped on the door.</p>

<p>A voice within responded feebly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the captain entered, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Gustavus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Captain, I disobeyed your orders.
I could not resist going to that ship and fighting
for the King; but here I am with my shoulder
shot to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, Mr. Gustavus,&#8221; replied
Captain Sutherland. &#8220;Are you hurt very badly?
I will send the ship&#8217;s surgeon to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The surgeon came and dressed the wound and
set the collar-bone, that had been broken. He
put Barclugh under strict orders that he must
not move out of bed for two or three days.</p>

<p>These three days were like sackcloth and
ashes to Barclugh. He was feverish to get to
Philadelphia, but the wound chastened his soul.
He grew sick at heart, when he lay bandaged up,
and the words of Mollie Greydon rang in his ears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Had I but serv&#8217;d my God with half the zeal</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;I serv&#8217;d my king,&mdash;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>He tossed restlessly, smarting under the pangs
of a contrite heart, and muttered to himself again
and again:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I only had half of the simplicity and happiness
of the new settler, Benjamin Andrews, all
the drafts on the Bank of Amsterdam that I
have on my person would be freely given. If
my life were linked with a pure and lofty spirit
like Mollie Greydon, and living on some lovely
estate like Dorminghurst, how free from all of
this turmoil and strife my life would be! No war!!
No great need of money!!! No jealousy!!!!
Just living serenely for the happiness of those
around me and for the glory of my Creator!&#8221;</p>

<p>If the sublime presence of a sweet and tender
woman had been able to minister to Barclugh
at this crisis of his soul, the better nature within
him would have triumphed over his sordidness,
and he would have given up to the better dictates
of his conscience. However, he fell into a deep
slumber, and when he awoke his body had become
rested and refreshed. Stern ambition was uppermost
in his mind again, and he began to plan
to get back to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The next day Barclugh commenced to recover
from the shock of his wound; he chafed under
the restraint that he was in; then he sent for
Captain Sutherland. As soon as Captain Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
entered the cabin where the spy was sitting
in an arm-chair, having his arm in a sling, he
spoke cautiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Captain Sutherland. I am
behind on my calculations two days already, and
I am very desirous of returning to Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to return, sir?&#8221; quizzed
the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have resolved on two possible means,&#8221;
answered Barclugh. &#8220;One is to engage a passage
on a fishing sloop; the other to go overland.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to be acquainted with a Swedish
fisherman who sold oysters in that city. He had
two sloops that plied to this inlet. If I could
be fortunate enough to find him, I could return
most comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I could be taken up Little Egg River
as far as a small boat could go and thereafter
depend on my own wits to reach Philadelphia
overland. I prefer the water route in a sloop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put me ashore at some fisherman&#8217;s hut and
I will take care of myself,&#8221; concluded Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that you are well enough to
make the journey?&#8221; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be as well off as I am waiting here,&#8221;
continued Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will give me two trusty men in a boat
to land me at the mouth of Little Egg Harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
River, I shall stop with the first fisherman that I
can find. I can buy his boat, if necessary, to take
me on my journey. A few guineas will look big
in his eyes,&#8221; argued Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Gustavus, I shall undertake
to land you whenever you are ready,&#8221; stated
Captain Sutherland, as he arose to leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be ready at sunrise,&#8221; replied Barclugh,
whereupon the captain left the cabin for the deck.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barclugh</span> had been landed, as agreed, by
the crew of the Albatross at the mouth of the Little
Egg River, and had made his way to the hut of
a Swedish fisherman; not a soul had seen whence
he came.</p>

<p>The fisherman&#8217;s hut was small, having been
built out of the logs that were found on the beach
and which had drifted from some lumberman&#8217;s
raft of distant Maine or New Hampshire; yea,
some claimed greater distinction. An experienced
eye could distinguish the mahogany log that had
floated from the West Indies with the Gulf Stream,
and had been blown on the Jersey sands by a
nor&#8217;east or sou&#8217;east gale. These logs were all
smoothly hewn and chinked with a mortar made
from the lime of the oyster shell and the sands
cast up by the waves.</p>

<p>The house sat on the shelving bank of the river,
surrounded by ragged nets, tar-smeared cauldrons,
floats and spars. A rather young woman stood
in the doorway, while two children with bare feet
played about and a yellow dog barked vociferously
at the stranger&#8217;s approach.</p>

<p>The children ran to the protection of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
mother&#8217;s skirt when they saw the man come near.
Two calves stopped their pranks to gaze at the
new-comer. Loneliness stuck out from every
corner of the habitation, and stolid contentment
was evident in every pore of the buxom young
Swedish mother.</p>

<p>Barclugh was at his wit&#8217;s ends when he strode
up to the doorway, after side-stepping a few times
to escape the charges of the dog. The woman
stamped her foot and ordered the dog off, in a
language foreign to Barclugh&#8217;s comprehension.</p>

<p>Bowing in his most gracious manner and holding
his hat in his one free hand, Barclugh said
graciously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Madam. Is your husband
at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer, except a dubious shake of the head,
accompanied by a most pleasant smile. She
walked into the one room of the house, and
offered Barclugh a chair when she had a good
look at his crippled arm and bandaged shoulder.</p>

<p>Everything about the fisherman&#8217;s home was
plain, yet scrupulously clean. The floor was
glistening with the purest of sand. The large
fireplace took up nearly the whole end of the house.
A kettle, a skillet, and a three-legged, shallow
pot sat on the hearth. A broad table was on one
side, which had been scoured with sand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
soft soap until the knots alone showed what character
the wood once had.</p>

<p>Without any ceremony, the good wife began
to prepare a meal. First she put a pot on with
fresh water, then went out to the river bank where
her husband kept lobsters and crabs in a small
trap. By using a small dipping-net, she brought
out a large lobster and a half a dozen crabs.</p>

<p>These were hurried into the steaming kettle,
and there sat Barclugh watching his meal cook,
while he became acquainted with the children
by making grimaces at them.</p>

<p>Barclugh ate his sea food, potatoes, and coarse
bread with much relish. He offered the good
housewife a piece of silver, but she only shook
her head in the negative.</p>

<p>The day wore on and Barclugh sat on the river
bank, watching the children build houses in the
sand, and the dog pant in the broiling sun. He
knew that the fisherman must come home, and
then he would find some one with whom he could
converse. However, a foreign-tongued woman
and guileless children suited his purpose, for the
less that he had to talk the better for him.</p>

<p>The sun was setting over the broad expanse
of sea-marsh, when a well-rigged fishing sloop
drew into the river&#8217;s mouth and landed at the
fisherman&#8217;s hut. Two gnarly Swedes and a lad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
jumped ashore. The older one was the husband
of the young woman, evidently, for she went
to the landing and in a few words explained
to him the presence of the stranger.</p>

<p>The Swede approached Barclugh, who noticed
that the fisherman&#8217;s face was much weather-beaten,
his beard shaggy and unkempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meester, you have been shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Barclugh anxiously. &#8220;I
am wounded and came near being captured by
those English ships of war. I want to go to
Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vaal, I go to Pheeladelpheea with my feesh
right avay. Eef you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you two guineas to take me there,
and two guineas more to keep silent, and let no
one know where I came from,&#8221; nervously added
Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aal right, I say nothing. I geeve you goot
passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh then handed him four guineas. The
Swede smiled and went into the house, where he
gave the gold to his wife, and got his bag of clean
clothes.</p>

<p>There were no delays in the Swede&#8217;s movements.
He jumped on board the sloop with
the other Swede and left the lad to stay with
the family.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>The sloop was well loaded amidships. An
assorted cargo of crabs, lobsters, bluefish, flounder,
and mackerel were all packed in ice, and covered
over with moss. Hatches were fastened athwart-ship
and bulkheads protected the cuddy and the
cockpit from the cargo of sea food.</p>

<p>The cuddy was forward of the mast, and a
square hatchway let the crew below to the bunks,
which were on each side of the keel between the
stem and the bulkhead.</p>

<p>The cockpit had seats all around it in the shape
of a half-circle. A barrel of fresh water rested
on the keel under the seat next to the after bulkhead;
little drawers were arranged under the seats
where dishes and food were stored; a small charcoal
stove was used to furnish heat in cold weather
and to cook the meals.</p>

<p>Barclugh was taken aboard and informed
that he could bunk in the cuddy until morning.
Then the fishermen hoisted sail and cast off the
moorings. He gladly accepted the offer, for
he had been well fed by the Swede&#8217;s wife, and what
he most needed was rest.</p>

<p>A long bag full of marsh grass was in the bunk
to lie upon, and a dunnage bag made his pillow.
The cuddy was as neat and clean as one could
expect aboard a fisherman&#8217;s craft. When the
water went swishing by on the sloop&#8217;s planking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Barclugh fell into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>The two Swedes were brothers. One was
married, and the other was his partner in the
fishing trade. The lad was a nephew that had
come from Sweden to live with his uncles. They
plied their occupation between Little Egg Harbor
inlet and Philadelphia, and sold their catch to
Sven Svenson. In the summer season they took
out enough ice each trip to keep their fish until
their return, and when Barclugh boarded their
sloop they were in a hurry to get to Philadelphia
in the shortest time possible.</p>

<p>The wind was light when the sun went down,
but with the rising of the moon the wind freshened
and carried them down the coast at eight knots
an hour.</p>

<p>Nothing disturbed the serenity of the trip.
When everything was sailing smoothly, the older
one crawled into the cuddy and occupied the bunk
opposite Barclugh. He slept soundly until after
midnight, when he relieved his brother and let
him turn in.</p>

<p>At sunrise Barclugh arose and after freshening
up with a good wash, he looked around to see
where they were. He saw the sloop heading
northwest, and a low-lying point of land astern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we now?&#8221; he asked, as he took
a good long breath of fresh air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>&#8220;Wee aare finfe hoors sail fram Pheeladalpheea,
Meester,&#8221; was the reply of the Swede at the tiller.</p>

<p>The younger one was busy at the cooking of
the morning meal. Barclugh discouraged talk
and the Swedes knew what they had been given the
guineas for.</p>

<p>The British spy took a seat forward and began
to swell with exultation when he pondered over
his journey to New York, his interview with
General Clinton, and his participation in the
capture of the Holker. Now he was speeding
to the conclusion of his journey,&mdash;the sloop
skimmed over the rolling waves of the Atlantic, as
his enthusiasm grew apace, and he thought of the
subjugation of West Point by intrigue.</p>

<p>When the sloop reached the fishmonger&#8217;s
landing in Philadelphia and Barclugh stepped
ashore, he walked unnoticed to his lodgings
and inwardly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Victory! Victory!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">No sooner</span> was Barclugh settled in his lodgings,
than he began to resume his business duties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hopewell,&#8221; he ordered, calling his clerk
from the accounting room to his private office,
&#8220;go, and inform General Arnold that Mr. Barclugh
has arrived and that he wishes to see him at
five o&#8217;clock in his private office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inform any personage of importance that I
had a fall from my horse and broke my collar-bone;
be careful to whom you impart this information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; replied the faithful clerk, as
he bowed himself out of the stern-visaged presence.</p>

<p>With his going, Barclugh threw himself upon
his couch, and rested his weary body. The
twenty days of exploit had been most eventful
and full of activities. Now that he had performed
his mission to New York, Arnold&#8217;s part alone had
to be carried out and the plot would be executed.</p>

<p>Weariness overcame Barclugh, and he slept
soundly until he heard a knock on his door.</p>

<p>Starting up with a dazed memory, he arose and
found Mr. Hopewell at the door, who informed
him that General Arnold was in the outside
office, waiting to see him by appointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Very well! I&#8217;ll see General
Arnold in a very few minutes,&#8221; said Barclugh,
reflecting for an instant.</p>

<p>Barclugh hurriedly washed and dressed and
as he passed through the accounting room, he
quietly said to his clerk:</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go now, Mr. Hopewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the door opened upon General Arnold
he arose nervously, and, as he beheld Barclugh
with his arm in a sling, he rushed forward and
seized Barclugh&#8217;s right hand in both of his,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how do you do, Mr. Barclugh? I hope
that you are not seriously injured? What,&mdash;what
hurt you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is nothing serious,&#8221; replied Barclugh,
as he languidly took a seat. His wan and weather-beaten
face had placed ten years upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p>The two conspirators sat down and for an
instant each gazed at the other to learn if there
were any sign of the white feather. To the steady
gaze of Barclugh&#8217;s steely blue eyes, Arnold returned
their inquisitive glance with a set jaw
and a determined look that could not be mistaken
for backsliding.</p>

<p>&#8220;How have you made out?&#8221; inquired Arnold
hesitatingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied Barclugh firmly. &#8220;I saw
Washington; I saw Clinton; I saw Risk killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good enough for that little pudgy piece of
conceit. He thought that he could whip all
Christendom with that Holker and fifty men.
So he&#8217;s killed! How did that happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh briefly related the whole journey,&mdash;the
capture of the General Monk, and the loss
of the Holker.</p>

<p>When it came to the capture of the Holker,
General Arnold became very much interested,
for his profits were in the cargo. He asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Barclugh, shall I receive anything
out of this Holker business now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we have sold the ship and cargo to the
English for whom it was intended, and the telltale
crew is disposed of. I will guarantee your share.
You need not worry about that. All that you
need to do now is to secure the command of West
Point. We will carry out the money part of
the agreement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; continued Arnold,
&#8220;but you see I am suffering for money; my debts
of five thousand pounds sterling are driving me
to destruction, and I wish that you could advance
me some to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh now saw his opportunity to crush
the independence of Arnold. At this pitiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
appeal for money, he arose with fist clenched, and
struck the table as he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, I have advanced you $3000!
I have undertaken the Holker enterprise for your
benefit! I have arranged to secure you twenty
thousand pounds for the delivery of West Point!
I have even secured for you the assurance of a
General&#8217;s commission in His Majesty&#8217;s service,
and all that has been asked of you is to deliver
West Point! Now you ask me to advance more
of His Majesty&#8217;s funds? No, sir, not until you
have done more of your part. You must secure
West Point!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who had suffered the privations
and starvation of an expedition at the head of
a half-clad army to capture Quebec in mid-winter,
and never lost heart, now quailed before
this ostentation of money. He hung his head
and in half-choking tones he arose and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have written to General Washington, and
I may hear from him very soon. I do hope
that you can help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Arnold finished the last sentence, he walked
out of the rooms of Roderick Barclugh with the
most forlorn expression. His chin was resting
on his breast as he walked to his home, there,
maybe, to receive another imperious demand for
money.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;General Arnold,</span> I can not and shall not
be subjected to these miserable indignities any
longer,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Arnold, as she hysterically
left her husband at the breakfast table
and went to her bed-chamber.</p>

<p>On the day after Barclugh had arrived in Philadelphia,
the Commander of the town had been
presented with the demands for the servants&#8217;
wages, bills for two gowns, and pay for the oysters
and fish from Sven Svenson, by his wife at breakfast,
and his reply was:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I have no money to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold was brave in the midst of battle, but
in the presence of an imperious and unreasoning
wife he was an abject coward. A look from his
wife was a command to Arnold, and he allowed
his domestic expenses to ruin him and drive
him into desperation, because he did not dare
to curb within his means an unreasonably extravagant
woman.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Arnold, in a fit of temper, had left
her husband, Arnold arose in dismay, then sat
down dejectedly in his chair. His brow was
wrinkled; his eyes wore an expression of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
fox, driven to bay; his frame shook with anguish;
his hands clenched his hair; and he sought relief
mentally, by reasoning out his situation to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;My love for my wife causeth me to do foolish
things, but I can not deny her anything that
pleases her. Her very look is a command to me.
When we married I thought our position demanded
a country-seat, and I bought it. When she asked
for a carriage and postilion, I furnished them.
When she wished to dine her friends of the Tory
party, I consented.</p>

<p>&#8220;But where has it led me at length? I am a
Major-General of the Continentals, and living
like a prince. Been married two years and five
thousand pounds in debt. Oh, that I could end
these pangs of pride! Yes, I shall end them.
I shall again see Roderick Barclugh. I shall
write again to General Washington and demand
my assignment to West Point,&#8221; concluded Arnold
as he arose and went to his wife&#8217;s chamber. He
tried to enter but the door was fastened.</p>

<p>An angry voice from within asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret, my dear, may I speak to you?&#8221;
meekly replied Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not have any explanation, General
Arnold,&#8221; savagely replied his wife; but she opened
the door and imperiously walked to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
side of the room, where she stood with her back
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; began Arnold, &#8220;I find that,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ll find that I and my child will
leave this house and you will find&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; interjected
Mrs. Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will let me explain?&#8221; continued Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t allow you to explain to me any more.
You have done nothing but explain ever since
you met me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall become of me and my child,
if things do not improve?&#8221; continued Mrs. Arnold
as she began sobbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that you will be ordered off to active
service and then you will be killed and what shall
become of me? There will be nothing left for
me to survive upon under this government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, my dear, I shall try and get
West Point. Then our fortunes will soon change.
We will not have all of the expenses of living
in the city; we can then pay off our debts. Besides
I have some commercial ventures that I expect
to bring in some returns very soon. I know
how you must feel when you see how much money
the FitzMaurices and the Millings and the Redmans
have and we do not have anything but
my meagre pay to live upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But remember, my dearest, I shall do all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
my power to make you happy,&mdash;even to giving
up my life. Oh! Margaret, bear up a little
longer and I shall be able to gratify every desire
that you may have. You know how much I
love you, and how happy we have been with
our boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quickly turning toward her husband, the
beautiful and young Mrs. Arnold put her face
poutingly up to his to be kissed, as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Benedict, I know that you love me, and I am
afraid that you love me more than I deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Arnold household had to contend with
two conditions that are sure to disrupt the tranquility
of a home. One was the imperious, unreasoning
ambition of the wife to shine socially,
and the other was the recognition, by the husband,
that his own social position was not equal to the
position that his wife was entitled to hold by
reason of education, family and environment.</p>

<p>Arnold had won fame in a few years on account
of his brilliant and daring military exploits, but
his reckless and obstinate nature had brought
him into disrepute. He lacked finesse and diplomacy.
His home and social surroundings demanded
wisdom that he did not possess.</p>

<p>He had been an apothecary, a horse trader,
and a sea captain. His enterprise in business
had been of the adventurous order. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
rubbed against the <i>hoi polloi</i> of Colonial times.
He was at home in a country dance among French
Canadians on his journeys to trade Yankee
notions for ponies, but when he entered the ultra-aristocratic
circles of Philadelphia as the military
commandant, he soon succumbed to the wiles
of the beautiful women and the luxury of gay
living; his head soon swam with the fantastic
notions of a new and gilded life.</p>

<p>He was an unsophisticated Adam, partaking
of the sweets of life with no preparation of the
appetite. His ardent nature was not tempered
with the prudence of experience. He glutted
himself like the gamin who enters a pie contest.
The wine was red and he desired to indulge himself
in its flavor. No consequences appealed to him
in his mad intoxication; he had no wisdom;
his gentility was crude. Although he was bold,
he was reduced by circumstances to a parasite;
he even surrendered his political principles to
those of his wife and her friends.</p>

<p>When these two social forces had met and were
joined in matrimony, an abject imitation was made
of the husband, and a tyrannical boaster of the
wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> his wife&#8217;s chamber, Arnold went
to the office of Roderick Barclugh.</p>

<p>He was smarting under the findings of the
court-martial at Morristown, and under the
monetary demands of a gay and ambitious wife.
He had proposed to resign his commission in
the army and settle upon an estate in the wilds
of Western New York, and let history right the
wrongs that had been heaped upon him, but the
ambition of his wife intervened again. Her love
of social distinction would not allow her to consent
to a home in the wilderness. What a glorious
record of heroism was thus turned into the wormwood
of infamy!</p>

<p>Desperation was written on his face when
Arnold reached the office of Roderick Barclugh,
who shook the General&#8217;s hand, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, General Arnold, that you do not
think seriously of my heated discourse toward
you yesterday, for I was weary and suffering
from my wound. I was then ill-humored and
out of patience. Anything that I can do to
relieve your financial difficulties, you may command
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>This unexpected liberality on the part of Barclugh
now won the heart of Arnold. The ointment
for a wounded spirit was in these words.</p>

<p>Arnold sat down and smiled as he rubbed his
hands and began to relate confidingly to Barclugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, my life, thus far, has been
full of hardship and bitterness. My honors have
been won with a heart true to my country; no
stigma yet rests upon my name; but my motives
have been misjudged and maligned; the designs
and calumny of wicked rivals have filled my
life with despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, my enemies have attacked the idol of
my soul,&mdash;my wife and the mother of my child.
Enough to arouse the bitterness of my being
were the attacks upon my own actions, but when
the opinions of my wife and her friends have to
be scored and laid up against me I am driven
to seek satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;The one burden of my soul that bears me down
to the depths of desperation, however, is that
of my debts. I have always been used to having
plenty for my simple needs, but the war has
impoverished me, and I can not get my just dues
from Congress. I owe the butcher, the baker
and the footman. My wife&#8217;s social ambition I
am not able to curtail. I am in the depths of
embarrassment over my debts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>&#8220;If it were not for what I owe I could not
consent to treason to extricate myself; but I am too
deeply involved. Indeed, too deeply!&#8221; concluded
Arnold as his voice choked, and huge tears trickled
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Not a word passed the lips of these men of
iron for a period that seemed oppressively long.</p>

<p>At length Barclugh broke the silence, remarking
compassionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear General Arnold, your life has been
worried to distraction by men of small and ungenerous
natures. They have sought to elevate
themselves by your undoing; but what must you
expect from a government such as you have in
these Colonies? There is no authority, no responsible
head. You, in your case, have no
appeal from a backbiting set of adventurers.</p>

<p>&#8220;But in government at home such services as
you have rendered have the reward of a peerage
and a grant from Parliament for the benefit
of your family.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use talking further, you can serve
your countrymen far more, by trying to put an
end to these injustices, perpetrated by an irresponsible
rabble upon personages of substance,
than by trying to win independence,&mdash;for what?&mdash;A
worse government, perhaps, than the one you
have had as Colonists.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>&#8220;In any event, the Commissioners of His
Majesty are willing to grant all the demands that
the Colonists have asked for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, General Arnold, you will pardon me,
but if I were to put two thousand pounds sterling
to your credit, as a loan, and leave it here for
your convenience, would that be of any service
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; replied Arnold most
graciously, &#8220;you have befriended me generously&mdash;I
am in need of friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not forget your kindness, but may
I ask you to let me have five hundred pounds
to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly,&#8221; returned Barclugh, and
he counted him out the amount in Bank of England
notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is only one matter I wish to impress
upon you, General Arnold, before you go,&#8221;
continued Barclugh, as he arose and took Arnold
by the hand. &#8220;I hope that you will press the
matter about West Point with General Washington,
and let me know at the very first moment what
news you get. I know that General Washington
desires to befriend you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Mr. Barclugh, I will keep you
posted. I expect news any day; still there is
a feeling within me that Washington is under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the influence of my enemies. He does not show
the cordiality to me now, that he used to.</p>

<p>&#8220;But never mind, I shall be able to give them
all a lesson in the manner of treating a gentleman,
when the war is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day, Mr. Barclugh, I am more than
grateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down at any time, General. We shall arrange
all details when you hear from headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good day,&#8221; concluded Roderick Barclugh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Segwuna, where have you been, my dear?
I have missed you so much,&#8221; were the words of
Mollie Greydon, when she saw Segwuna for the
first time in two weeks. Segwuna was in the
winding path leading to the old mill on the Wingohocking
at Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>Segwuna turned around at the sound of Mollie&#8217;s
voice, and walking toward her, put an arm around
the waist of her friend and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been to New York selling some moccasins
and leggings,&#8221; for she did not desire
to let Mollie know the whole of her reasons for
going to New York.</p>

<p>Segwuna continued spiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;While there I saw General Clinton and
Major Andre. They live in such grand style,&mdash;a
coach and postilion, just like General Arnold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>&#8220;Those grand people have no love for an
Indian girl like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind, my sweetheart! I love
you,&#8221; retorted Mollie sweetly, as she embraced
her friend and kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s go down to the mill, Segwuna,&#8221;
continued Mollie. &#8220;We can sit down and relieve
our hearts to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mollie had been much agitated ever since Mr.
Barclugh&#8217;s visit to Dorminghurst. She had been
affected by the very peculiar and earnest look in
his eyes at the breakfast table. She had seen
neither Barclugh nor Segwuna since then, and
her delicate nature had dwelt upon the tender
gaze in Barclugh&#8217;s eyes and thoughts of what
it might mean had haunted her by day and by
night. If she could have told Segwuna, she would
have found relief, but Segwuna had left the same
day that Mr. Barclugh had gone to New York.</p>

<p>The two life-long friends, with arms around
each other&#8217;s waists, now sauntered down to a
lonely spot around the old mill to tell of their
fears and their hearts&#8217; desires. Mollie believed
that Segwuna had wisdom, so that the Indian
maiden was the oracle that Mollie consulted
when she had burdens on her mind.</p>

<p>These two childlike natures had that implicit
confidence in each other that is born of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
They sat on the mill-race, under the shade of
a huge elm. As Mollie buried her head in
Segwuna&#8217;s bosom, the fountains of pent-up grief
broke out and Mollie wept and wept until Segwuna
pacified her by stroking her brow and sweetly
asking:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, my loved one? Has
Segwuna offended you, sweetheart? What makes
my love so unhappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Segwuna, I thought that you had been
lost or killed or that something terrible had
happened to you. You never stayed away so
long before. I have been looking for you every
day, and you did not return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you have returned and you have
not changed,&mdash;you still love me?&mdash;I cry for joy.
But then, Segwuna, I have a secret to tell you,
and you must not laugh at me, for then I shall
think that you do not love me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; continued Mollie, &#8220;that
the day that Mr. Barclugh was here, and we were
talking at breakfast about the King&#8217;s courtiers,
I happened to repeat those lines of Shakespeare:</p>

<p>
&#8216;Had I but served my God with half the zeal<br />
&#8216;I serv&#8217;d my king, he would not in mine age<br />
&#8216;Have left me naked to mine enemies.&#8217;<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;When I had finished these lines, the eyes of
Mr. Barclugh gazed at me, and such a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
shone out of them, I have not been able to rid
myself of the look that he gave me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna, what does it mean? I am troubled
by day in my thought and by night in my dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not find you, my darling, to let
you know what troubled me. I have been unhappy
every minute since then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my sweetheart,&#8221; replied Segwuna, &#8220;I
shall pray to the Great Spirit to protect you from
harm; but there can be only one interpretation
of what you have told me,&mdash;it means that Mr.
Barclugh is in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A thunderstorm had arisen from the southwest,
while the two girls were occupied in their
heart to heart communion, and the two ran into
the old mill for protection. The terrific wind
and downpour of rain shook the old mill. When
the sharp bolts of lightning and the heavy crash
of thunder seemed very near, Mollie clutched
Segwuna by the arm, and hung to her spasmodically,
as fear seemed to multiply in her already
much agitated breast.</p>

<p>When Segwuna turned at last to leave for her
mother&#8217;s lodge, she kissed Mollie on the cheek,
and whispered gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna will pray to her Great Spirit to
protect her sweetheart from all harm. Good
night, darling.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barclugh</span> took his meals regularly at the
Boar&#8217;s Head Tavern, and lived industriously
attending to his plot, and to his speculations in
privateering.</p>

<p>He was busy organizing his bank, the capital
of which was mostly subscribed and whose
charter was drawn and placed before the Council
of Pennsylvania for legal authority to do business.
The corporation was to be known as the Bank
of North America; Thomas Milling was to be
its first President. Every detail was copied as
closely after the corporation of the Bank of England
as possible; that was Barclugh&#8217;s plan.</p>

<p>If Barclugh had confined himself to his plot
with Arnold and to his plans in financiering, he
would have been better off. But the allurements
of commerce had also attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Ships of all descriptions were in the stream,
awaiting a berth to load or unload. Some were
at the wharves of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice, loading
or unloading merchandise and munitions of war.
Privateers and merchantmen, brigs and barques,
full-rigged ships and sloops,&mdash;all were a kaleidoscope
of the cosmopolitan elements of Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
The Malay, the Portuguese, the Negro, the Indian,
the Caucasian, the Creole, were all bartering and
seeking adventure on the seas. They were in a
harbor where war now offered all of the prizes
and all of the calamities of life. The calamities
claimed the greater share in the final results.</p>

<p>Among all this motley crew lurked disease,
lust, and greed. The leaders of the enterprises
reeked in greed, the hirelings exceeded in lust,
but disease had no favorites.</p>

<p>Diseases were cosmopolitan like the people.
Cholera from the Orient, <i>peste</i> from the West
Indies, scurvy from the Antipodes, fevers from
the ships and the camps of armies kept the city
in continuous mourning. Though disease played
the heavy role in this drama of life, still it acted
its part when least expected.</p>

<p>Barclugh desired to buy a ship of Milling and
FitzMaurice, and send her out to the West Indies
with a cargo of flour, and return with rum and
sugar. The profits would be large. He now
had much money at command and no use for it.
He thought that a few dollars turned over for a
profit would not come amiss when he began
his career after the Colonies were turned over
to the mother country.</p>

<p>There was a ship, the Sea Nymph, lying in
the Delaware, a prize belonging to Milling &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
FitzMaurice which had been bound from Havana
to London, laden with rum and molasses; but her
crew was attacked with the <i>peste</i> and inside of
a week two thirds of her men were stricken with
the disease.</p>

<p>In this critical condition the Independence,
privateer of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice, ran upon
the Sea Nymph, and she struck with no resistance.
Enough of the crew of the Independence who
were immune to the disease were put aboard to
take her into Philadelphia. The Sea Nymph
was a new and handsome ship. She was lying
in the stream waiting for her turn to discharge
cargo, when Barclugh learned about her, and,
although advised of the perils of the dreaded
<i>peste</i>, he offered to buy her. Barclugh&#8217;s impatience
to be doing business prevailed against his friends&#8217;
judgment, and he went aboard of her to inspect
the ship.</p>

<p>His weakened physical condition put him under
susceptible conditions to take the disease, and
in ten days thereafter, Roderick Barclugh was
stricken with the <i>peste</i>.</p>

<p>However, before this event, matters had culminated
fast in Barclugh&#8217;s affairs. The tenth
day of July, 1780, had arrived, and communication
had been opened up between Barclugh and
Andre at New York. By means of a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
pounds sterling, Barclugh had arranged to have
letters addressed to John Anderson, Esq., New
York, delivered to a boat from the Albatross,
that landed at the Swede&#8217;s fishing hut on the Little
Egg River. In return the fisherman brought
a sealed package addressed to Mr. Gustavus,
Philadelphia. Gustavus was the name of the
Swede.</p>

<p>This line of communication was maintained
at regular intervals,&mdash;whenever a load of fish
came from Little Egg Harbor inlet, a sealed
letter was delivered to Barclugh and an answer
returned.</p>

<p>When Roderick Barclugh fell ill, he awoke
in the early morning with terrible pains in his
back and loins. He found that he was unable
to arise, suffering intensely with a fever and pains
in his joints. His man-servant went as usual
to the door of Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s sleeping apartment
but he did not find him astir, and as he listened, he
heard slight groans. When he gently opened the
door, there was Barclugh, helpless, breathing
heavily, his eyes bulging. The only thing to
do was to bring Doctor Biddle.</p>

<p>When Dr. Biddle arrived, a hurried examination
of pulse, eyes and tongue soon convinced
his experienced eye that the patient had the most
dreaded of diseases in the seaport of Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>&mdash;the
<i>peste</i>. By this time the sick man was unconscious,
and the Doctor turned to the servant
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to inform you, but this gentleman
has the <i>peste</i>. Who has charge of his affairs?
We shall have to procure him nurses and medicines.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though a thunderbolt had come out of a
clear sky, James, the servant, stood speechless
and perfectly colorless at this announcement.
At last he regained his self-possession and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will notify Mr. Milling; he knows Mr.
Barclugh best. But I can not stay here and
nurse him myself. My wife and children would
die of fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; remarked the Doctor, &#8220;you have been
exposed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! all right! Doctor, but you see there&#8217;s
a mighty difference betwixt the nursing of it
and the staying away from it. Let these rich
men who can afford to die, be having the risks.
I will go and tell Mr. Milling.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he put on his hat and ran to the
office of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice, and without
any ceremony rushed into the presence of Mr.
Milling, simply announcing:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, my master, has the <i>peste</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>James then rushed out of the office of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
merchant prince, and up Front street, telling
every person that he met:</p>

<p>&#8220;My master, Mr. Barclugh, has the <i>peste</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, inside of an hour, the whole town was
put in a fever of excitement. Soon the number
of cases was reported as a score; rumor had it
that every one had been exposed.</p>

<p>At the office of Milling &amp; FitzMaurice, a hasty
consultation was held between the partners.
The conditions under which the ship, Sea Nymph,
had come into port, and how Mr. Barclugh had
inspected her and had arranged to buy her, were
discussed. The cargo of the Sea Nymph was
in their warehouse, and no one could foretell
the consequences.</p>

<p>During this discussion of their own affairs,
Milling &amp; FitzMaurice did not think of Barclugh.
The Doctor waited and waited for some one to
come, but no one came to his relief. The accountant,
Mr. Hopewell, had heard the news on his
way to the office, then had gone home to consult
with his wife.</p>

<p>At last the Doctor became worried, and leaving
his patient alone, he went to the office of Milling &amp;
FitzMaurice.</p>

<p>As he entered the accounting room, he walked
quietly up to Mr. Milling and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, I sent Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s servant to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
you that that gentleman had the <i>peste</i>, and that
he must have nurses and attention for he is a
very sick man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the man did not ask us for nurses,&#8221;
contended Mr. Milling. &#8220;He simply told us
that Mr. Barclugh was sick with the <i>peste</i>, and
we had no idea that our services were needed
for a mission of that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no time to talk, gentlemen. Mr.
Barclugh lies unconscious with fever, and I do
not know to whom he can appeal in his distress
but your house. Good day, gentlemen, I must
be with my patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the Doctor had left, Mr. Milling
looked at Robert FitzMaurice as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, what shall we do about this? I can
not tie myself up for three weeks and be exposed
to this fever, and neither can you. Our affairs
can spare neither you nor me. Is there not some
poor devil whom we can get to nurse him? Barclugh
has plenty of money with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; responded FitzMaurice. &#8220;There is
Barton, he needs the money, and he owes us;
he ought to go and do this; he could then square
our account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barton was one of the men in the warehouse
of the firm and had a young wife and four children.
When the offer was made to him in the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
his employers, he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, my life and my family are just
as dear to me as either of yours. I would not risk
my life in that service for all of your combined
wealth. My life is exactly as dear to me as to
any prince or potentate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Milling looked at Robert FitzMaurice
with a dissatisfied air, as he followed Barton&#8217;s
footsteps and closed the door behind him, while
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe Barclugh will be in pretty bad shape,
before we can get any one to nurse him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, the news of the
fever began to travel outside of Philadelphia.
Express messengers went on horseback to the
north and to the south, and on the way to Germantown,
the news of Barclugh&#8217;s fever reached
Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon at once notified his wife and
daughter. In less than half an hour his carriage
was ready, and he had left, prepared with delicacies
and medicines to succor a fellow being. There
was no calculation of consequences on his part.</p>

<p>Mollie asked her father if she might accompany
him, but he explained that she could be of little
assistance, so she stood on the portico, and watched
her father&#8217;s carriage until it had reached the road
through the avenue of hemlocks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>But no sooner had her father&#8217;s carriage vanished
through the trees, than she ran with all of her
might to the lodge of Segwuna.</p>

<p>With eyes full of despair, she ran up to Segwuna,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna! Segwuna! I have just learned that
Mr. Barclugh has been stricken with the <i>peste</i>,
and father has started to go to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Segwuna! what shall I do? What shall
I do? I am fearful that something will happen
to him, and father would not let me go to help
nurse him,&#8221; as she burst into a fit of heart-rending
sobs and buried her head on Segwuna&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not weep, my sweetheart. If you cannot go,
Segwuna can go. I will go and take the medicine
that will save him. Do not fear, my dear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna will nurse him back to you. Be
calm and let me get ready. It will not take me
long to reach his side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna went to her mother and gave her a
few directions; in a few minutes she was ready
with a bundle of herbs, and with light step, and
the light of a guardian angel shining out of her
beautiful eyes, she and Mollie took the winding
path down to the Wingohocking, then through
the avenue of hemlocks to the highway that led
to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mollie stopped at the huge gate at the roadside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and kissed Segwuna thrice, as she bade her Godspeed,
and prayed silently:</p>

<p>&#8220;That the sick one would have the protection
of Divine Providence in his affliction, and that
God would bless the efforts of her friend, Segwuna,
to lead the sick one out of the &#8216;valley of the shadow
of death,&#8217; and bring him nearer to his God and
His Son, Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless you,&#8221; was the parting salutation
to Segwuna as Mollie stood and watched the
Indian maiden go lightly on her mission of mercy.</p>

<p>She watched her until Segwuna was a mere
speck in the roadway, and then turned silently
to go to her bed-chamber to pray for the man,
whom she felt was dear to her, yet she could
not tell why.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Dr. Greydon reached the bedside of
Roderick Barclugh, Dr. Biddle was bathing his
patient&#8217;s hands and arms, and laboring over him
to reduce the temperature. As the two doctors
met in the sick-room, Dr. Biddle arose and quietly
addressed his friend:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Greydon, I am glad that you have come.
This gentleman is suffering from a severe wound
in the shoulder, and this fever has attacked him
in a virulent form, and unless we can reduce
the temperature, his chances are very slim for
recovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am surprised to learn that he is
wounded,&#8221; replied Dr. Greydon, &#8220;but I heard
that he undertook a perilous adventure to pass
through the enemy&#8217;s lines into New York, on
a business enterprise; but where did he get this
fever? Are you sure that it is <i>vomito negro</i>?</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume that he met with some hair-breadth
escape when he undertook to get out of New
York. How long has this paroxysm been running?&#8221;
continued Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since early this morning,&#8221; replied Dr.
Biddle. &#8220;He was in his usual health yesterday,
his servant told me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>Dr. Greydon quietly bent over the patient,
and went through all the formalities of a medical
examination. When he had finished he looked
at Dr. Biddle and dubiously shook his head, as
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor, your diagnosis is correct. He certainly
has <i>vomito negro</i>, and the depressed condition
of his system from the shock that the wound
has caused, must make his case critical, very
critical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; continued Dr. Biddle, &#8220;if we can
reduce the fever, he will have to receive careful
nursing and I have notified Milling &amp; FitzMaurice
that they shall have to send this gentleman
a nurse, but none has come yet; and it is four
hours ago that I saw them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, this matter must be attended to
at once,&#8221; contended Dr. Greydon, &#8220;and if you
can remain a while, I will go and try to procure
the necessary person and bring him here at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is good, Doctor,&#8221; replied Dr. Biddle.
&#8220;I can continue the bathing, and I can relieve
the congestion by bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as Dr. Greydon reached the street, and
was about to enter his carriage, he heard a voice
calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor! Oh Doctor!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Doctor turned and there was Segwuna.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>&#8220;What is it, Segwuna?&#8221; asked Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to help nurse Mr. Barclugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not afraid, my child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna is not afraid to do her duty, Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Segwuna,&#8221; replied Dr. Greydon.
&#8220;Then we will go in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leading the way to the Barclugh apartments,
Dr. Greydon conducted Segwuna to the sick-room
on the second floor, and as they entered,
the other medical man remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, our wishes were quickly answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me introduce Segwuna, the granddaughter
of Altamaha; she resides on our estate and she
has volunteered to help rescue the afflicted&mdash;I
know that no one could do it better,&#8221; were the
words of Dr. Greydon, as he took off his coat
and began to get ready for the care of Mr.
Barclugh.</p>

<p>Segwuna immediately straightened out the room.
She went with Dr. Greydon through the house,
and they found a large fireplace in the kitchen
of the residence where Barclugh had his business
offices and sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>There were a few pieces of wood so that a fire
was soon going on the hearth. Then a memorandum
of necessary articles of household utility
was made, and in a very few minutes it seemed
as though an angel had flown into the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
desolate house. As Segwuna went from room
to room, silently arranging a piece of furniture,
and opening the windows and shutters, sunshine
seemed to drive chaos away.</p>

<p>The life that Barclugh led seemed to be wrong;
when sickness came upon him, money was mute.
There was no loving kindness ready to be shown
to him, except what came from God&#8217;s messengers.
Poor mortal! He was lying unconsciously helpless,
ignorant of the loving hands that now administered
kindnesses unto him.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the household was settled
down to a routine; Segwuna had medicines,
delicacies, linen and food for a long and tedious
battle with the dreaded <i>peste</i>, but better still
she had the instincts of a true nurse.</p>

<p>The sleeping-room on the second story, being
the sick-room, she closed the shutters to let in
a minimum of light; she placed a pure white
linen cloth on the table; she kept cloths wet with
vinegar on the parched brow of the patient.
A vase of pinks that had been sent by Mollie
from Dorminghurst was tastefully placed upon
the table. In the restful moments of the sick
man, she slipped down stairs to the kitchen and
prepared a hot mustard bath for the feet, to
relieve the congestion in the brain. Wrapping
the patient in a woolen blanket, she placed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
extremities in the hot bath, and then put him
between clean linen to cool his burning body.</p>

<p>During the first twenty-four hours, the paroxysm
of the fever was intense. The temperature was
105 degrees Fahrenheit, and as Barclugh lay
suffering on his back the groans and tossing of
the sick one were heart-rending. He was only
semi-conscious most of the time, but Segwuna
never flagged in her attentions. After Dr. Biddle
had first administered a simple emetic, and then
performed the customary bleeding for the first
stages of the disease, a large dose of calomel and
subsequently a half-tumblerful of <i>oleum ricinum</i>
was administered to relieve the alimentary canal.
It was then a fight of physical endurance against
disease.</p>

<p>However, Segwuna knew that the doctors were
groping in the dark in treating this disease, so
she felt that much depended upon her skill in
keeping down the temperature, and keeping up
the sick one&#8217;s strength, in order to stand the
ravages on his vital organs. When Barclugh
tossed and raved in his delirium, she saw that
he placed his hand upon his chest and stomach,
and she felt that the fever must be burning the
vital organs. So she prepared a hot plaster of
mustard and placed it on the pit of his stomach.
In a short time the patient seemed to get more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
quiet, and he rested easily until morning.</p>

<p>The second day Dr. Greydon arrived very
early; as soon as he saw the patient, he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Segwuna, how is the gentleman this
morning? I see that he is not quite as flushed
as he was yesterday. If his strength will hold
out to-day and to-morrow, we can hope to get
him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dr. Greydon, Mr. Barclugh is easier
this morning, but he was very sick at midnight.
He was nervous and in great distress so I put a
mustard plaster on his stomach and it immediately
quieted him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did perfectly right, Segwuna, my child.
This fever seems to attack the membranes of the
stomach, and if you apply external applications,
you draw the congestion from the vital spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Segwuna,&#8221; continued Dr. Greydon,
&#8220;you go and rest yourself, while I remain here.
Then you will be able to stand another night&#8217;s vigil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I shall do so,&#8221; and Segwuna went
to the couch that she had prepared for herself
in the former dining-room, where she slept
soundly until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Dr. Biddle came and relieved
Dr. Greydon at the bedside of Roderick Barclugh,
so that he was not a minute without constant
watching at his side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Between the two doctors a consultation was
held, and they both agreed that the sick man had
a fighting chance for recovery, if his constitution
could stand the wear on his stomach and heart.
No food was to be administered until the fever
was reduced, and then slight stimulants were
to be given to re-enforce the action of the heart.
Segwuna could nurse him by night, and the
two doctors agreed to divide their time during
the day with the patient.</p>

<p>When Segwuna awoke from her sound sleep,
she made her way to the sick-room, and found
Dr. Biddle taking his temperature with his
thermometer.</p>

<p>The temperature was 104 degrees Fahrenheit,
and the pulse was 95 and a glassy stare was noticeable
in the eyes of the sick man who lay there
in a condition of stupor. His face was of a
purplish-red hue, and his cheeks began to lose
that full and lively glow of health; a parched and
drawn appearance of the skin over the cheek-bones
began to be noticeable.</p>

<p>Also during the day he had suffered a few
attacks of the <i>vomito negro</i> that taxes the strength
of the human organism to the utmost.</p>

<p>Dr. Biddle whispered to Segwuna as she came
beside the sick-bed:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very sick and you better give him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
teaspoonful of this solution in that tumbler every
half-hour. If he can hold his own for the next
thirty-six hours, he will begin to gain. This
paroxysm of the fever usually reaches its crisis
within three days, and after that, if his strength
is sufficient to sustain vital action, his case is
hopeful. But Segwuna, it all depends on the
heart. This high temperature and this terrible
pulse! If it lasts too long, there can be no hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Doctor, I know that this <i>peste</i> is a very
grave disorder, and I shall not neglect your
instructions,&#8221; replied Segwuna, as Dr. Biddle
gathered up his medicine case and left.</p>

<p>The pride and power of man vanish when
dread disease lays him low and brings him next
to dissolution!</p>

<p>As Segwuna arranged all matters for her
night&#8217;s vigil, she suddenly turned toward Barclugh,
for, as he lay prostrate, his arms were waving
wildly in the air as he exclaimed in his delirium:</p>

<p>&#8220;Arnold loves money! Yes, he loves money!
Yes, General Clinton, he will get West Point
from General Washington. I have offered him
twenty thousand pounds sterling, and a General&#8217;s
commission in the British army. Oh, that I
had served my God with half the zeal I served
my King. Yes, she is beautiful in her virtue.
Oh! that wound will be the death of me! Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Risk shot me. There! There! All hands!
Steady! Lads! Aim low!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh say, Miss, was I talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much, Mr. Barclugh, be calm,&#8221; replied
Segwuna, as she held the hand of the spy, and
stroked his head, as he closed his eyes and dozed
off into a semi-conscious state.</p>

<p>These words of Barclugh in his delirium,
though disconnected, agitated Segwuna beyond
measure. She had seen Barclugh leave on the
Sloop-of-War Albatross when she spoke to him
at Paule&#8217;s Hook in the dark. She had followed
him to New York after he had visited at Dorminghurst.
She had traced him to the Beekman
House, and now she heard him in his delirium.</p>

<p>Segwuna knew that this referred to Arnold.
She reasoned thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;What conspiracy was this that had been
divulged to her? Must she inform Congress?
No. She had come here because she loved
Mollie Greydon, and she must save Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s
life. The Great Spirit had given her this knowledge,
and she must find out all she could about
Arnold and Mr. Barclugh. She could serve
Congress by wisely learning all she possibly could.
She must not blast Mollie&#8217;s hopes until the whole
truth is known.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night augured badly for Barclugh. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
awoke from his stupor about ten o&#8217;clock, and his
eyes showed intense suffering and sadness. He
not only suffered intense physical agonies, but
when his mind regained lucidity, thoughts of his
plot with Arnold surged through his mind, and
the look of anguish on his face was most pitiable.</p>

<p>As the hour of eleven o&#8217;clock drew near, Segwuna
noticed that the eyes of her patient glistened
more than before, and an expression of abject
helplessness came over his face. His face was
flushed perceptibly and the nervous stroking of
his stomach indicated to Segwuna that her
applications of mustard ought to be applied.</p>

<p>After these were administered to the feet
and stomach, quietude succeeded the restless
spell and the sick man lay peacefully until Dr.
Greydon arrived in the morning. He noted a
material reduction in the patient&#8217;s temperature.
It was now down to 100 degrees, and the crisis
seemed passed; but still the lower temperature
did not indicate assurance of recovery.</p>

<p>When the fever begins to decline a period of
low fever and depression follows. If a relapse
now occurs, the patient succumbs; but Segwuna
watched over her charge for ten days, until he
was able to sit up and partake of some solid food.</p>

<p>During the period of calm succeeding the
paroxysm of fever, an event occurred which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
threw more mystery than ever around the career
of Roderick Barclugh.</p>

<p>One morning very early before the break of
day, when not a sound disturbed the sick-room
but the tick of the clock, and an occasional ship&#8217;s
bell announcing the change of the watch, a loud
rap sounded on the front door. Segwuna was
all alone.</p>

<p>She went to the door, and there stood a burly
Swedish fisherman whose eyes bulged in astonishment
to see a woman appear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked Segwuna sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Maister Baarkloo,&#8221; drawled
the Swede.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very sick with the <i>peste</i>, I do not believe
that he is able to see any one,&#8221; spoke up Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haf sam lettar for heem, aand I give to heem&mdash;nobodday
alse. I keep not mysalf,&#8221; argued
the Swede doggedly, as he started to come in.</p>

<p>Segwuna stood in the doorway attempting to
block his passage, but the Swede brushed her to
one side and went straight for Barclugh&#8217;s room,
and Segwuna followed closely after him.</p>

<p>When the Swede reached the door of the sick
man&#8217;s room, he raised his hat and tiptoed up to
the bedside of Barclugh.</p>

<p>As he stood beside the bed he drew out of his
pocket a long sealed envelope, addressed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">&#8220;Mr. Gustavus,<br />
<span class="gap2">&#8220;Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From John Anderson, Esq., Merchant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Swede hesitatingly looked at Barclugh and
saw him lying there and staring with a glassy
look in his eyes, unable to speak or to recognize
the Swede.</p>

<p>The fisherman turned stolidly to Segwuna
as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do my duty. I gav to nobodday alse.&#8221;
As he said this he left the packet on the bed,
turned with a sad air, and walked out of the
house as mysteriously as he had come.</p>

<p>Segwuna took up the envelope and examined
the address. She knew that the Swede was a
fisherman from the New Jersey coast. She
had seen Roderick Barclugh walk to the sloop
of war at Paules&#8217; Hook with Major Andre, and
she had seen them both leave General Clinton&#8217;s
house together.</p>

<p>She found Roderick Barclugh in Philadelphia,
when she returned from New York. He could
not reach here by the sloop-of-war, so he must
have landed on the coast and have been brought
here by the fisherman. As these thoughts ran
through her mind, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found it! The letter has traveled
the same course, and John Anderson is John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Andre.&#8221;</p>

<p>What this shrewd woman could fathom out of
the statements in Barclugh&#8217;s delirium and what
she had seen in New York, was that Arnold
was to go over to the British. If Arnold got
West Point, she could put two and two together
and connect him with the twenty thousand pounds
sterling and the General&#8217;s commission in the British
army.</p>

<p>Segwuna reasoned to herself as she watched
the sick man, and thought of what she ought
to do:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the clew to this poor man&#8217;s secret.
His villainy must be stopped. I shall not leave
one stone unturned to fathom his plans. This
letter contains important facts. I shall deliver
it when he recovers and watch my opportunity
to learn its contents after he has broken the seal
himself. Any other course would arouse his
suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she took the letter and placed it in the drawer
of an escritoire and resolved to deliver it as soon
as Roderick Barclugh regained enough strength
to read it.</p>

<p>When the episode of the letter delivered by
the Swede had been well considered, Segwuna
reasoned to herself again:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must not arouse the suspicions of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Barclugh. If I let him go on he will weave a net
to entrap himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, Segwuna was enabled to learn the contents
of the secret correspondence after it had
been given to Barclugh, who was too feeble and
too sick to think that the simple Indian maiden
was interested in his affairs.</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks, Roderick Barclugh
was strong enough to be moved from his quarters.
Consequently, after a most thorough destruction
and cleansing of his effects, Dr. Greydon insisted
upon taking Roderick Barclugh to Dorminghurst
to recuperate his depleted body.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barclugh,</span> a mere shadow of his former self,
was driven in the carriage of Dr. Greydon to
Dorminghurst. As he passed along Front Street
and up Market Street, he was saluted by General
Arnold who smiled graciously to see his friend
convalescing and out of doors.</p>

<p>When Dorminghurst was reached, there could
be no mistaking the evident gratitude in Barclugh&#8217;s
wan features as he saw Mollie rush out of the
door and down to the carriage, extending both
of her hands to him, as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How glad we are to see you with us again,
Mr. Barclugh! I know that you will get strong
very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How kind of you to greet me so cordially,
Miss Greydon. I owe my being here to-day
to your esteemed father and to Segwuna,&#8221; replied
Barclugh soberly as he arose with difficulty and
got out of the carriage with the assistance of
Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon walked with Barclugh and assisted
his feeble footsteps to the bright and airy room
overlooking the Wingohocking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greydon greeted him on the portico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
with such kindly words of welcome, and the black
servants stood looking on with such respectful
silence, that Barclugh could not help but wonder
if it were not his own mother in his own home who
was now greeting him.</p>

<p>The Doctor soon made him lie down on the
snowy white bed, and ordered an egg-nog for his
refreshment.</p>

<p>Sentiments of the tenderest feelings welled
up in his breast upon the receipt of such hospitality,
and he murmured to himself as he lay on his
bed, peacefully resting:</p>

<p>&#8220;This kindness to me passeth all understanding.
How shall I ever express my gratitude and return
this compliment that has been paid me? No, I
never expected such treatment as this from
the hands of those whose cause I am endeavoring
to defeat. Well, my turn will come, and then I
shall show them my breeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the next few days Dr. Greydon would not
allow Roderick Barclugh to move out of his bed,
for his strength was not enough yet to allow
very much exertion; but the new surroundings,
and especially the beautiful presence of Mollie
Greydon, were an inspiration to him.</p>

<p>Mollie took a lively interest in the welfare
of her father&#8217;s guest and patient. Every morning
she brought a fresh bouquet of the brightest flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
from the garden and placed them in the sick-room
herself; then in the afternoon, she brought
her Latin works along with her, and read selections
to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_332fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">She noticed how longingly he watched her depart.</p>

<p>In the sweet modulations of her voice, Barclugh
found repose as he lay on his bed,&mdash;weak and
emaciated. His strength was not enough to allow
him to converse at much length, so that after
Mollie had read these classics to him, his heart
throbbed with tender emotions and the words
that left his lips when she had finished:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Miss Greydon,&#8221; had the pathos
of a heart full of gratitude.</p>

<p>As he lay with mind so clear but his body
so weak, he often dreamed to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if my God will only restore me to my full
powers again, I shall live only to be worthy of the
love of Mollie Greydon. She must be all that
is worth living for,&mdash;beauty, grace and loving
kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each day as Mollie brought the fresh flowers
to the sick-room, and on each occasion that she
read to the sick, she noticed how longingly he
watched her depart, and how he beamed with
joy whenever she entered his sick-chamber to
read some well-chosen classic.</p>

<p>In the course of a week, Roderick Barclugh
began to recover his appetite, and at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of two weeks, he was strong enough to ride out
in the carriage with Mollie and the Doctor.</p>

<p>The three would drive in the morning and in
the latter part of the afternoon as far as Germantown,
and along the banks of the Delaware.</p>

<p>These drives greatly benefited Barclugh&#8217;s
health; he had also a most excellent opportunity
to get acquainted with the one who was the desire
of his heart.</p>

<p>One day as they drove toward Philadelphia
they met Segwuna. Nothing would satisfy Mollie
unless she rode with them.</p>

<p>Mollie made room for her on the seat in the
carriage that faced Dr. Greydon and Mr. Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that our patient looks much
improved, Segwuna?&#8221; queried Dr. Greydon, good-naturedly,
as the carriage rolled along the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Dr. Greydon,&#8221; answered Segwuna, uncomfortably,
as she sat looking vacantly into
the carriage top.</p>

<p>The others attempted to be gay, but Segwuna&#8217;s
presence cast a gloom over the ride; she neither
smiled nor talked except in monosyllables.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned anything of importance
to-day in the city, about our affairs of war,
Segwuna?&#8221; cheerily asked Mollie, turning to the
Indian maiden with her happiest smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Miss Greydon, except what traitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
would be interested in,&#8221; spoke out Segwuna,
sternly.</p>

<p>At the mention of the word &#8220;traitor,&#8221; Segwuna
looked straight at Roderick Barclugh, and she
noticed a twitching of his lips and a visible blush
mounting his neck and ears.</p>

<p>To allay any possible attention to himself,
Barclugh now entered into lively conversation
with Dr. Greydon and Miss Mollie, and utterly
ignored Segwuna, who sat stolidly in a brown
study during the rest of the carriage ride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Greydon,&#8221; began Barclugh spiritedly,
&#8220;I am much interested in the agriculture of the
Colonies. There seems to be a wonderful fertility
to the soil, for a settler can go upon land with no
capital but his hands and a yoke of oxen, and
inside of a year have a comfortable plantation
established. How can it be done? I do not
understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The soil is rich in the first place,&#8221; replied
Dr. Greydon; &#8220;then our American products of
Indian corn and potatoes provide abundance
for man and animals, so that there is no difficulty
in subsistence. The natural meadow and the
grasses of the woods provide for sleek cattle
and horses; then the abundance of wild pigeons,
ducks, and turkeys and the fish of the rivers
and lakes also provide food; the hides of the deer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
bear, coons and squirrel provide raiment and
robes. There is no reason for man to suffer in
this wonderfully prosperous country, if he be
industrious,&#8221; argued Dr. Greydon, with much
satisfaction to himself, but evidently to the discomfiture
of Barclugh, for he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all so strange to me. I cannot understand
how the settlements start up like mushrooms
in the wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the promise of the Great Spirit,&#8221; contributed
Segwuna. &#8220;But our soil must be forever
free from the tyranny of kings and potentates,
or the corn would not grow and the potatoes would
wither and a famine would devastate the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna is our prophetess, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221;
declared Mollie, exultingly, &#8220;and we all love her
dearly,&#8221; continued Mollie, as she turned to
Segwuna, and putting her arms around her neck,
kissed her.</p>

<p>Barclugh did not relish the affection that Mollie
showed for Segwuna, so he remarked emphatically:</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot rely on superstition, Miss Greydon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The latent fire of the Indian character gleamed
in Segwuna&#8217;s eyes, and she longed in her heart
to wither Roderick Barclugh, but the time was
not ripe. Segwuna simply kept silent and abided
her time.</p>

<p>After the carriage had arrived at Dorminghurst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Dr. Greydon and Barclugh sat upon the portico
and conversed upon sundry subjects while Mollie
and Segwuna strolled off together toward Segwuna&#8217;s
lodge, Mollie remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Something has made you unhappy, Segwuna.
What has happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing, my sweetheart. Your Segwuna&#8217;s
heart bleeds for her country&#8217;s welfare, and I can
see that something is to happen during the next
moon that will make us all unhappy; but your
Segwuna can not tell her sweetheart now. It
might make me wish that I had not spoken about
it, if it should not happen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that my dearest one would excuse
Segwuna and let her go to her lodge, and pray
to her Manitou to clear her sky and bring happiness
to her spirit, for her heart is very sad to-day,&mdash;very
sad to-day,&#8221; repeated Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, my loved one,&#8221; replied Mollie.
&#8220;Your Mollie loves you and knows how pure
and noble her Segwuna is. Good night, dearest.
Good night,&#8221; were the parting words of Mollie
Greydon, as she kissed Segwuna, and left her to
return to the mansion.</p>

<p>While the two were strolling on the winding
path, Roderick Barclugh and Dr. Greydon sat
on the portico and conversed freely. Barclugh
resolved to confess the longings of his heart before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
his departure, as he knew that he must soon leave
Dorminghurst.</p>

<p>He opened the difficult subject by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Greydon, I have now been a guest at
your house for two weeks, and under trying
circumstances to your household. I feel that
I owe my life to your tender care and solicitation.
My father could do no more for me; but I hope
that you will not consider I am presuming on
your good nature, when I unfold to you an affair
of my heart; and ask of you one of the greatest
favors that one man can bestow upon another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Greydon,&#8221; continued Barclugh, &#8220;ever
since I first met your daughter, I have esteemed
her as one of the most talented and beautiful
women in this country, and since I first was a
guest in your home, I have learned to love her;
I ask you to give her to me for my wife. My
position and means and prospects warrant me
in making this request and I hope that I may
deserve the great honor that I ask you to confer
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment of silent reflection, Dr. Greydon
replied most reverently and in the peculiar language
of his Quaker persuasion, which he used
only on occasions of great emotion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast been good enough for me to invite
thee to my home. If I had not thought thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
good enough to be my son, thou shouldst not
have been my guest; but my daughter must give
thee her own consent before thou canst have
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the conclusion of these solemn injunctions,
Barclugh arose, silently shook the hand of Dr.
Greydon and retired to his bed-chamber for
meditation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the evening after Barclugh had asked
the consent of Dr. Greydon, an air of expectancy
pervaded all except Mollie. Dr. Greydon had
told his wife about Barclugh&#8217;s request and she
realized the importance of this day to her darling
daughter, who was one of the flowers of the earth
in her sight.</p>

<p>A mother rejoices in the proper selection of
a husband by her daughter, and Mrs. Greydon,
one of those good, wholesome souls, believed in
whatever her husband proposed, so that when
the Doctor informed his wife of Barclugh&#8217;s
intentions, she simply said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou knowest best what is right, William;&#8221;
and was satisfied to rest on his wisdom.</p>

<p>Mollie was utterly oblivious to the ordeal
in store for her on this particular evening. She
was more witchy and poked more lively sallies
at Barclugh during the dinner than she ever
had before on any one occasion, but Barclugh
blushed and took the pleasantries good-naturedly.
Yet Mollie noticed that she was doing most of
the talking, and wondered to herself why everybody
was so sober and she so lively. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
her buoyancy of spirits could not be downed and
she continued her play of wit and humor throughout
the dinner.</p>

<p>When the dinner was finished, Mollie said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the prettiest ode of Horace that I
was translating before dinner, and I must have
papa and mamma and you, Mr. Barclugh, come
to the library and I will read it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Barclugh offered Mollie his arm, and Dr.
Greydon his to his wife, and the four went up
the great staircase to the library.</p>

<p>Mollie went to the book-shelves, while the others
seated themselves on the carved oak settles, facing
each other before the great fireplace. Mollie
took the edition of Horace and seated herself
at the head of the large library table and began
to read:</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the ode, Dr. Greydon
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mollie, there is much wisdom in our Latin
poets. Simplicity and virtuous lives are the
safeguards of nations. When Horace sang, the
Roman people began to feel the dangers of wealth
and riotous living; may our own country escape
these baneful influences.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Greydon looked at her daughter with
loving eyes when she had finished her translation,
and turning to Mr. Barclugh, said as she arose
to leave the young people to themselves:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, we take much pleasure in our
Mollie&#8217;s preaching. We hope that she will not
bore you.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon the Doctor and me for
retiring so soon, but we have many duties to
perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Doctor and Mrs. Greydon then left the
library to allow the young people to have their
own conversation.</p>

<p>When Dr. and Mrs. Greydon had left Roderick
Barclugh and their daughter to their fates, Barclugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
sat on the settle with his arms folded on his
breast, and looking squarely at Mollie Greydon,
ventured the words that were burning within
his heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Greydon, I wish to address you on a
subject that is most dear to my life. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Barclugh, what is it that you mean?&#8221;
interrupted Mollie as she put down her book.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Greydon, I believe that I could recover
my former health more quickly if I could settle
one thing in my mind,&#8221; continued Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that if there is anything to be done
you ought to do so at once, Mr. Barclugh, for you
have been a very ill man,&#8221; returned Mollie, as
she looked at him and saw that peculiar expression
that she had noticed in his eyes when he sat
opposite her at the breakfast table two months
before.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh now looked at Mollie,
who instantly felt that some great ordeal was
impending. He arose and took Mollie&#8217;s hands
in both of his as he knelt at her side, and pleaded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Greydon, I have loved you since that
day I first met you at your father&#8217;s table. My
life is a void without your presence at my side.
Will you be my wife?&#8221; he asked as he took Mollie&#8217;s
hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>

<p>Mollie sat in her chair as though she were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
fashioned from marble. Her beautiful face was
transfixed away from Barclugh, and her gaze
was that of a frightened fawn. She could not
answer.</p>

<p>At length Barclugh pleaded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak! Mollie, speak! My heart and my
life go out to you with sincerity and love! Will
you consent to be my bride, and make me the most
favored man on earth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mollie arose and went to the other end of the
library table, and looking at her lover said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible that you could love me,
Mr. Barclugh. I am a Quakeress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That matters not, my dear Mollie. I have
learned that God&#8217;s loving kindness resides within
the hearts of your people. I was saved from an
untimely death by the love and kindness of your
dear father, and I know that you had no less
to do with it than he. So I feel that I am the one
to be unworthy of any affection that your heart
possesses,&#8221; contended Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am highly complimented, Mr. Barclugh,
by your kindly and unexpected attentions to me,
but I feel so unable to render any one happy that
I could not answer you at once. I must have
time for meditation and consultation with my
parents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no reason, dearest, why you ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
not to have time. If you will only consent to
consider my love, so that I shall have an opportunity
to prove my worthiness, I shall be more than
happy. Promise me this much, Mollie. I shall
then have a chance to show you how much I
love you?&#8221; pleaded Barclugh passionately.</p>

<p>Mollie sat down at the end of the table, buried
her face in her arms and began to sob and weep
pitifully, and Barclugh stood disconsolately at
the other end of the table.</p>

<p>At length Barclugh went to the end of the table
where Mollie sat, and taking her hand in his,
he knelt at her side, and pleaded earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mollie, will you satisfy the longing of my
heart by promising me that you will answer me
in a month? Just give me a ray of hope, that
I may live for your sake. Mollie, just promise
me, just promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between the sobs that fairly tore the heart&#8217;s
moorings of Barclugh, Mollie replied, feebly:</p>

<p>&#8220;In a month, Mr. Barclugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh then took her hand and kissed it
until he was beside himself; then he arose and
left Mollie alone in the library.</p>

<p>He resolved to go to his own lodgings the
next morning, determined to win his loved one
by the ardor of his attentions.</p>

<p>Mollie&#8217;s supersensitive mind was overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
by the appalling nature of the question that
was made to her; and she thought how unworthy
she was to make another mortal happy for a lifetime.
She needed the guidance of reflection and
the help of prayer to the All-wise Being that
cares for the most humble of His creatures.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Barclugh arrived at his office on the
day that he departed from Dorminghurst, Benedict
Arnold was there.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon had left his guest at the door and
before entering his carriage, shook Barclugh
heartily by the hand, as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast my blessing, my friend, and may
our happiness always continue as bright as it
has been in the past fortnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh was so overcome by the sincerity
of his former host and benefactor that he was
visibly affected when he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you sincerely, Dr. Greydon, for all
that you have done for me. I owe my life to
your attentions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give my love to Miss Mollie,&#8221; were the parting
words of Roderick Barclugh, as he turned to
enter upon the sterner duties of his business.</p>

<p>Greeting Arnold by the salutation: &#8220;Good
morning, General,&#8221; Barclugh walked into his
private office, followed by Arnold who shut the
door behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted to see you so well, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221;
began Arnold. &#8220;It does seem more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
four weeks since you were taken ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have good news for you, Mr. Barclugh.
My commission as commander of West Point
has been promised. I have seen the Commander-in-Chief
personally.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall move my headquarters there this week.
Now all that we need to do is to arrange the details
of the surrender when I get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; interrupted Barclugh. &#8220;I
can communicate with you and forward your
correspondence through our old channel until
you wish to arrange the details, when you can
plan to meet Major Andre and make out a plan
of attack and surrender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it, there need be no hurry
until I get on the ground and fix things,&#8221; continued
Arnold enthusiastically. &#8220;But Mr. Barclugh,
before I can decently leave this town, I must
settle all my household debts. So, if you can
favor me with five hundred pounds to-day, I shall
be pleased. I will simply consider it as an
advance in the total amount. I need it for
expenses, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly, General Arnold, you
must get away as soon and as decently as possible,&#8221;
replied Barclugh, going to the iron safe on the
other side of the office to get the money.</p>

<p>When General Arnold had received the money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and arose to depart, he smiled significantly to
Barclugh, as he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am feeling like my old self once more.
My fighting blood is up. No use talking, the
sinews of war put the nerve in a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to go at once, Mr. Barclugh,
but my duties are pressing, and I must close
up my affairs here at the earliest possible moment.
Good day, Mr. Barclugh. I feel very grateful
for your assistance,&#8221; concluded Arnold as he
left Barclugh&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh called his clerk into his
private office, as soon as General Arnold departed,
to give his orders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hopewell, you may see Messrs. Milling &amp;
FitzMaurice and close all of my privateering
and other accounts with them except the Bank
of North America matter. Tell them that my
illness has necessitated my giving up everything
except the banking business, which shall now
receive my exclusive attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; answered the
faithful clerk, as he proceeded to carry out these
injunctions.</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh now had accomplished the
purposes for which his dealings with Milling &amp;
FitzMaurice had been started. He had used
this channel to ensnare Arnold and to procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
an introduction to the leaders of society in Philadelphia,
Tory and Whig, alike.</p>

<p>But there was only one question, if he were
to withdraw his whole account from Milling &amp;
FitzMaurice, they might be embarrassed. Having
planned to put this amount into the bank,
he could let it lie in their hands, as a loan, until
the bank was established.</p>

<p>General Clinton must now be advised of the
turn of affairs, so Barclugh busied himself at
the task of writing a complete history of the
transactions since the beginning of his illness and
despatched the letters by the Little Egg Harbor
inlet route.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Segwuna read the letters of John Anderson
that had been brought from New York by
the Swedish fisherman, she could not bear the
sight of Roderick Barclugh. The thought of
Mollie Greydon ever loving this man who was
visiting General Clinton and Major Andre, and
conspiring with General Arnold and at the
same time visiting the Greydon family, was
repulsive to her. She did not yet possess knowledge
positive enough about Barclugh to inform
Mollie of its nature; nor did she yet really know
that Mollie was in love with Mr. Barclugh. Still
she fully intended to devote her attentions to
this conspiracy and expose its operations, if
possible.</p>

<p>As Segwuna lay on her couch of mats in her
mother&#8217;s lodge, on the day that she had been
invited to ride in the carriage with Mollie and
Mr. Barclugh, she went over and over again all
that she had learned:</p>

<p>&#8220;I first saw Mr. Barclugh after Mollie had
met him at the dinner party given by Robert
FitzMaurice. Every day that I went to Philadelphia
I found Mr. Barclugh at the office of Milling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
&amp; FitzMaurice or at General Arnold&#8217;s. In
watching him I followed him to the office of
General Arnold on the night before he visited
Dorminghurst. I learned that he was going
to New York to visit General Clinton and get
a commission for General Arnold in the British
army if Arnold turned over West Point. The next
morning he stopped at Dorminghurst and visited
my friends. I could not inform any one of what
I knew for fear of implicating my friends, for
I did not know what the relations were between
Dr. Greydon and Mr. Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, it is all clear to me. Dr. Greydon does
not know anything about Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s business.
Mr. Barclugh pretends to favor independence,
but he is striving to overthrow it. When I
followed him to New York, I suspected more;
when I heard his exclamations in the delirium
of fever, I was convinced. The letters brought
by the fisherman have shown that he is in communication
with the English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna must not rest night nor day until
this spy is foiled in his designs; if I should inform
anybody, suspicion might fall upon my friends
at Dorminghurst who have befriended Mr. Barclugh
and saved his life. That course would never
do, so the duty falls upon Segwuna alone to
overthrow the spy&#8217;s work and save her friends!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>She set about her task of thwarting Barclugh
with much zeal. She walked to Philadelphia
and went immediately to Front Street near
Barclugh&#8217;s lodgings. The first thing that met
her eyes was the departure of General Arnold
from the office of the British agent.</p>

<p>Segwuna kept her own counsel, but she was
alert and active. She went to the Halls of Congress
and watched for any news that might be
of importance to her task. She heard Mr.
Livingston talking to General Schuyler about
West Point, so she stopped to listen.</p>

<p>The conversation was about the report of the
committee on army affairs, and Mr. Livingston
stopped General Schuyler in front of Carpenter&#8217;s
Hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Schuyler, have you done anything
on your committee about Arnold&#8217;s assignment?&#8221;
asked Mr. Livingston. &#8220;I have written to the
Commander-in-Chief and asked him to assign
Arnold to West Point. His wounded knee will
not allow him to ride a horse and that fact unfits
him for active service in the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are right, Mr. Livingston,&#8221; replied
General Schuyler, &#8220;Arnold is a valuable man.
The soldiers admire him. We will assign him
to post duty and recommend giving him
West Point, if he declines to take the field. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Commander-in-Chief wishes him to be active
in the coming campaign, but if Arnold insists
upon garrison duty, he may get whatever he
wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>This settled the matter in the mind of Segwuna,
for she knew that Arnold desired West Point.
Now Segwuna must determine what she ought
to do to keep her eyes on Arnold and Barclugh
at the same time. She learned from the fish-vender,
Sven Svenson, another point that put
her on her guard.</p>

<p>Sven was ambling along Market Street with
his fish cart, when Segwuna stopped him and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Sven, what is the news in
town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Val, I hap gude news, Miss Segwuna; Ganral
Arnold has pade me up tan pound starling an&#8217;
sax pance,&#8221; answered Sven as he showed the
guineas and smiled blandly at Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;He vas going to da army to vark. I gass he
vaants Vast Point. My saster who varks for
Mistrees Arnold, she tald mee so mach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that he will get it, Sven?&#8221; asked
Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! He gats vat he vants,&#8221; retorted Sven,
smiling more than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sven,&#8221; replied Segwuna knowingly,
as she started on up the street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>Philadelphia&#8217;s streets contained little knots of
men and women discussing the latest news,
and everybody had it on his tongue that General
Arnold was about to leave town, and no one was
sorry, for his cold and overbearing manners
had disgusted even his friends with him.</p>

<p>His extravagance and debts had brought unsavory
gossip upon himself and household. As
Segwuna went through the market-place where
two old women,&mdash;seasoned gossips of the town,&mdash;stood
and regaled each other, she paused to hear
their chatter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard about General Arnold and
his spouse?&#8221; quizzed the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? About paying off his debts?&#8221; questioned
the second.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where he got the money? I heard
that he sold merchandise to the enemy,&#8221; continued
the first one.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he went to Connecticut last month and
has just returned. He must have had property
there and sold it,&#8221; argued the second one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard what they named their boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Edward Shippen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? That old Tory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. Those Shippens have turned
Ben Arnold&#8217;s head. He&#8217;s not the same since he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
became mixed up with that lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ben Arnold used to be a fine soldier
before he knew those Shippens. Now he doesn&#8217;t
want to fight, he wants to lie around and play
the dandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard that General Washington wanted
him to join the army, but his wife is afraid that
he will be shot. That&#8217;s a pretty pass. I wonder
if she&#8217;s better than any of the rest of us? We
have husbands and sons fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder where they will put him? I heard
that he wanted to go to West Point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if I were General Washington, I wouldn&#8217;t
do anything like that. There must be some
fire where there is so much smoke. He doesn&#8217;t
want West Point for any good purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I believe Ben Arnold is all right at heart
if those Shippens didn&#8217;t have a noose around
his neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor man! I feel sorry for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, do you know that I started to go to
market, and here I am talking yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my case too, I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come over to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Segwuna came into Philadelphia every few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
days. She kept close watch on the movements
of General Arnold. She knew that as soon as
he got stationed at West Point, matters would
begin to move between him and Major Andre.
Accordingly, she learned when Arnold left Philadelphia.
She also heard about ten days thereafter
that he had taken command at West Point,
August 3.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Segwuna to do when
she had learned that Arnold was stationed at
West Point except to be on the ground where
she knew the dealings between Arnold and Andre
would take place. The next move that she
made was to get her affairs at home all arranged,
and tell her mother that she was going to New
York.</p>

<p>She could meet Major Andre and advise him
against his plot. If that plan failed, she could
make her way to General Washington and advise
him of the advance of the British troops. Thus
her friends would have no suspicions cast upon
them for their intimacy with Barclugh. Then
when the plot had been foiled, she could return
to Philadelphia and advise Dr. Greydon about
Barclugh&#8217;s participation in the plot.</p>

<p>Mollie Greydon was sitting on the portico
at Dorminghurst just after a visit from Mr.
Barclugh one warm afternoon in the latter part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of August. She had just been receiving the most
marked attentions from her lover. He never
missed paying his respects to her at least three
or four times a week.</p>

<p>On this afternoon, Segwuna came tripping
down the avenue of hemlocks, and before she
got to the portico, Mollie put down her needle-work,
and ran to greet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Segwuna,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have been
so mysterious of late, I have not seen you for over
two weeks. What has been the matter? I
have something to tell you, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come, my sweetheart, to tell you that
Segwuna is going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going away?&#8221; cried Mollie. &#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to New York for General Washington,&#8221;
replied Segwuna. &#8220;His enemies are
conspiring to defeat his plans and Segwuna&#8217;s
duty calls her to go. I have studied out what
my duty is and I have worked to get ready to
go now. But before I go, I thought that I would
come and tell you.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_360fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Mollie put down her needle-work and ran to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not let any one know where I am
going, not even your father,&#8221; cautioned Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, Segwuna. Now I must tell you a
secret of mine,&#8221; returned Mollie. &#8220;Do you
know, Mr. Barclugh has asked me to marry him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you promised him?&#8221; demanded Segwuna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
impulsively, as her face became the picture of
solicitude.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you look so eager and ask me that
question?&#8221; asked Mollie impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;But tell me, have you promised? If you
have, I know that you would have told me,&#8221;
argued Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I have not promised. I asked a month
to consider.</p>

<p>&#8220;I also wish to learn about his family and
his business. I believe that he loves me, and I
believe that I could love him. He is so handsome,
and a perfect gentleman,&#8221; continued Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true, my dear Mollie. I know that he
loves you. He may be very rich too, but you
must know all about his business. He has been
in Philadelphia less than a year. He was introduced
by Benjamin Franklin, but his business
is unsettled. Privateering is very precarious,&#8221;
argued Segwuna.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, my dear Mollie, Segwuna&#8217;s life is devoted
to yours. Promise me just one thing. Do not
give your consent until Segwuna returns. If
you promise him in this moon, your life may
be unhappy. Wait until the next moon and
everything will be clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that your advice is good. I must
be certain that he loves me and that I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
make him happy, before I consent. Because,
when I once promise, my lot is cast,&#8221; reasoned
Mollie, as Segwuna kissed her, and walked
sprightly down the avenue of hemlocks.</p>

<p>Mollie was resigned to wait. The wisdom of
the Quaker character was sufficiently grounded
in her to cause her to be sure of her step before
she made one, and there were so many things
to be considered before she could promise.</p>

<p>Segwuna looked a perfect picture of nobility
of character this evening, when she left Mollie
at Dorminghurst. Her tall, lithe figure and
elastic step, her dark hair hanging in a braid
upon her back, her long, oval face, firm mouth,
deep-set eyes, aquiline nose, bare head and olive
complexion combined to produce a distinguished
presence. Her dress consisted of a tunic of buckskin,
a short skirt, leggings and moccasins of
the same material. She wore no ornaments
and the only thing that encumbered her on
her journey was a bag or knapsack made of
fine buckskin suspended on her back by means
of a strap over her shoulders and breast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Barclugh</span> grew impatient and chafed under
the uncertainties of his position. He had restricted
all of his business since his illness to the
plot with Arnold and to the establishment of a
bank among the merchants. Arnold was now
at West Point and had been joined by his wife.
The latest despatch that Barclugh had in Philadelphia
from Andre was that negotiations had
been opened up with Arnold and that he expected
to have the whole matter consummated within
a week.</p>

<p>In spite of the apparent serenity of his affairs,
he paced the floor by day and tossed in his bed
at night. The thoughts of Mollie Greydon&#8217;s
demeanor of late disturbed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not enter into conversation with
her former frankness and abandon. There must
be some restraining influence at work. I must
have this uncertainty off my mind. I shall go
to her to-morrow and have my mind clear about
her love for me. Her time of a month for the
consideration of my proposal will be up in a week,
but I cannot postpone this longer. I must
settle the matter to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>On the day succeeding his resolution, Barclugh
went to Dorminghurst early in the afternoon and
invited Mollie to accompany him on a horseback
ride to the Delaware.</p>

<p>Mollie received her suitor with a gracious
smile, as it was perfectly evident that she admired
Mr. Barclugh (for in spite of his despicable
secret mission he was worthy of better things)
and the two very soon were on their way, gayly
cantering down the avenue of hemlocks.</p>

<p>The afternoon was one of those sere, autumn
days in late October. The sun shone through
a hazy smoke and the air was crisp and bracing.
The smoke curled out of the chimneys, lazily
ascending, loath to leave the environment of its
former condition in the fireplace; but the calm
atmosphere allowed the ethereal vapor to hover
about the old chimney and house and to fill the
hemlocks with a pungent incense.</p>

<p>This pungency of the smoky atmosphere oppressed
Barclugh but to Mollie it was like a sweet
odor. She rattled off small-talk, as, aglow with
her buoyant spirits, she rode her prancing bay.</p>

<p>Barclugh never had such a task to perform
as now confronted him. To broach the subject
nearest his heart would cast a gloom over the one
whom he loved better than his own life. As
he rode closely to the side of his companion, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
could feel his heart throb violently, and as he
sat stolidly in his saddle, between his monosyllabic
answers to Mollie&#8217;s gayety, he thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails you, old soul? Are you losing
the power of speech? What a pity to molest the
happy life of such a perfect being! But we are
selfish. Yes; her life must be linked with mine.
She can make me a better man. Is it something
in the poise of her head? is it something in the
way that she rides her horse? No, it is what
she thinks, her unconscious nobility of soul,
that enthralls me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Barclugh, let us take a spurt on
this fine stretch of road. My Prince is chafing
for a dash,&#8221; suggested Mollie as she looked up
into her companion&#8217;s face, who evidently was
in a reverie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Barclugh, somewhat
startled. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; So he spurred his horse
and as if by magic the two finely-bred steeds
responded to the spirit of their riders and leaped
into the air for a brush.</p>

<p>Barclugh at once was on his mettle. To be
challenged for a race by the one whom he adored
was the tonic needed for his soul. The somber
spell that depressed him was gone as he turned
and saw Mollie urge on her steed. She was a
daring horse-woman; her mount was peerless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Barclugh felt the blood mount to his hair as Mollie
came up and rode past and smiled roguishly
at her lover as she distanced him.</p>

<p>Mollie reined in and turned around with her
face full of animation as she asked spiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for my Prince, Mr. Barclugh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid! splendid!&#8221; exclaimed Barclugh in
admiration of the restless steed and the aristocratic
form of Mollie, who, breathing fast, glanced at
her whip with which she struck her habit, for
she intuitively felt the ardor of Barclugh&#8217;s gaze
and the blood mounted to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Here was the moment for Barclugh to ask the
question uppermost in his mind. But he did
not. The power to encroach upon the sacred
precincts of the innermost soul of the one whom
a refined nature loves is like admiring the rose
and then tearing up the roots that give it being.
A refined nature pauses at desecration.</p>

<p>Barclugh had offered himself, and Mollie
had asked a month to answer. The gnawings
at a man&#8217;s heart often lead him through labyrinths
of impatience and indiscretion that are hard to
untangle and bring him into paths that are serene
and pure. But on the other hand, it often happens
that the woman withholds her answer to
a man&#8217;s avowal because she must satisfy the
questionings of a heart that needs more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
mere avowal to convince her that the man is
sincere and thoroughly in earnest.</p>

<p>However, the exhilaration of the gallop with
Mollie had cleared the cobwebs from Barclugh&#8217;s
brain. He looked upon Mollie as magnificently
noble and pure. She would certainly answer
him at the end of the month and if then she
could not declare herself, he would know that
some further proof of his devotion must be made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet after all of the fine calculations that one
can make,&#8221; thought he, &#8220;love thrives without
reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their way now lay through a wooded glen.
The horses stepped smartly and pranced proudly
as their nostrils extended out of their classic
heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful this day!&#8221; exclaimed Mollie
with enthusiasm. &#8220;I rejoice to be here!&#8221; as
she stroked the arched neck of her steed with her
shapely gloved hand. Mollie rode her horse as
though she were mistress of the situation. Her
feminine intuition told her that her lover was
craving to declare his devotion, but she would
have despised him for it. She knew that the
ground on which she trod was sacred until the
four weeks had passed. Yet she was fearful
lest the promise to Segwuna could not be kept.
Her party was to be held in two days and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
was to dance in the minuet with Mr. Barclugh.
She was satisfied as things were.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you so happy and beautiful
this evening, Miss Mollie?&#8221; ventured Barclugh
at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Mollie archly.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I guess?&#8221; queried Barclugh after some
reflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t guess. I don&#8217;t like guessing,&#8221; retorted
Mollie impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you <i>will</i> allow me this time?&#8221; returned
Barclugh in his most dulcet tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I can not,&#8221; replied Mollie, as she spurred
her horse and started on a canter, Barclugh
following her lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Mr. Barclugh, there is the Delaware!&#8221;
exclaimed Mollie as she pointed toward a broad
expanse of the river, at the same time looking
at Barclugh with a roguish twinkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound those four weeks,&#8221; thought Barclugh;
then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see so much in that to rave over.
I am interested in better views. I am interested
in you, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; protested Mollie.
&#8220;You ought to have better sense,&#8221; while she
good-naturedly laughed at the evident discomfiture
of her lover.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>Barclugh now colored, for he felt sheepish in his
awkward position. In another instant, however,
he smiled, himself, and they rode down the banks
of the Delaware discussing pleasantly the beauties
of the landscape.</p>

<p>Barclugh recognized the fact that the fates
were against him and he concluded that the
better part of valor was to wait for a more propitious
time. However, something within told
him that the present was his opportunity, for
he thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;He who hesitates is lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road now took them over the Wingohocking
as the crimson setting of the sun shone over
the rippling water and the autumnal hues of the
landscape mellowed the disappointment in his
breast.</p>

<p>When the avenue of hemlocks at Dorminghurst
was passed and he led Mollie from her horse
up to the portico, Miss Mollie smiled more than
graciously as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Barclugh, I shall depend upon
you at my party for the minuet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Greydon,&#8221; replied Barclugh,
bowing very low, &#8220;but don&#8217;t forget that I shall
claim my answer in another week.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We next</span> find Segwuna in New York. She
was well acquainted with the way thither, for she
had traversed it many times. While pursuing her
purpose in New York, Segwuna lived with a small
band of Iroquois on Staten Island.</p>

<p>Segwuna found much favor among the ladies
of the English officers, for her skill as a prophetess
was already established.</p>

<p>She now made it her particular business to call
often upon the ladies of General Clinton and
General Knypthausen; and, also, upon Major
Andre in his office, one afternoon, when the
principal business of the day was over.</p>

<p>The offices of the Adjutant-General of the
British Army were at No. 1 Broadway, in one of
those old Dutch houses the entrance of which led
up a short flight of steps to a huge door having an
iron knocker.</p>

<p>Dormer windows faced the street in the second
story, and the hip roof was covered with shingles
that were coated with moss and lichens,&mdash;evidences
of an ancient construction.</p>

<p>When Segwuna rapped with the iron knocker on
the huge door, a red-coated English Sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
opened it, and the prophetess modestly inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Major Andre in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Madam,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very busy,&#8221; returned the Sergeant.
&#8220;Will you give your name, and state your
business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that Segwuna, the Indian prophetess,
has news to tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come in and be seated?&#8221; continued
the military man, who ushered her into the outer
office of the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>Segwuna went into the outer office and sat
down while the Sergeant rapped on the door of
the private office, and a voice within said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sergeant opened the door carefully and
walked up to the desk of the Adjutant-General
and stood at attention until Major Andre turned
from a letter on his desk and glanced up at the
soldier, who saluted:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; brusquely asked Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;A young Indian woman, who calls herself
Segwuna, the prophetess, wishes to bring you
news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show her in, Sergeant Donovan,&#8221; ordered
Andre.</p>

<p>The Sergeant went to the outer office, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
politely informed Segwuna:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Adjutant says that he will see you,
Madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna tripped lightly to the door and entered
the presence of one of the most polished and handsome
gentlemen of the British army. Dressed
in the most fastidious manner, his young and
pleasing face shone out with an animated expression
of good-will as he arose and bowed gracefully
to Segwuna and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be seated, Miss Segwuna. I have heard very
pleasing accounts of you from Madam Clinton.
Do you wish to tell me what my fate will be, this
evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had heard the ladies of his acquaintance
raving over the wise and peculiar speeches of this
Indian maiden, and Major Andre thought that he
also ought to have something to relate.</p>

<p>A weak point in the military composition of
Andre was his romantic and artistic disposition.
He loved the society of ladies. His graceful
manners and polished speech and writings gained
him friends among the ladies of his associates; but
his love of foibles and gossip led him into channels
that detracted from his military achievements.</p>

<p>When Segwuna proposed to tell his fortune, he
yielded from the very constitution of his nature.
He desired to have a good tale to tell his lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
friends at the next dinner party, where he was sure
to be lionized.</p>

<p>Segwuna simply replied to Major Andre&#8217;s
question, modestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Major Andre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that I have no very bad omen in my
fortune, Miss Segwuna?&#8221; said Andre, quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Segwuna shall have to tell you the truth,
Major Andre,&#8221; replied Segwuna soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, do you believe that I am going to
succeed in my enterprise, Segwuna?&#8221; asked Andre,
bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends on the will of the Great Spirit,
Major Andre,&#8221; began Segwuna, as she started to
relate her account to the Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna sees that something very momentous
to you and your cause is going to happen this moon.
The nature of your business concerns the fate of a
great fortress and a brave general. I can see the
general walking up and down the bank of a great
river, waiting to speak to you. He wants you to
come to him, but if you go to him, he is sure to
give you directions that will bring ruin to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;These enterprises will require you to travel by
land and by water. If you keep on the water, you
will have no harm come to you, but beware of the
land.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Spirit has been kind to you, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
does not love your cause. You are fighting
against the will of the Great Spirit when you try
to subdue the land to which he gave the Indian
corn. The Great Spirit hath decreed that every
man is to be his own master, and there is
to be no distinction between men, in the land
of the Indian&#8217;s corn. If the hunters starve,
the chiefs are to starve also.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that you expect a letter of importance.
It is to be brought by a boat and a fisherman
from a distant city. The letter comes from a
gentleman that has your secrets. He writes
under a different name from his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many trials for you to pass through
during the next moon, and if you leave the city
on a journey to the general walking on the banks
of the great river, you shall lose your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna paused and said no more.</p>

<p>Andre sat as though fixed to his chair. His
thoughts were afar off. The words of the Indian
maiden seemed to stun him, and confound his
understanding. He started to rise and to speak,
but he sat down again, turned away and began
to think.</p>

<p>At last he regained enough presence of mind
to state to Segwuna:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am profoundly impressed with what you say.
I shall be pleased to consult you again. I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
that I shall reward you sufficiently by giving
you this small token of my esteem,&#8221; as he arose
and held out in his hand a guinea for Segwuna
to accept.</p>

<p>Segwuna arose and declined the proffer of the
gold by declaring with dignity:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Mr. Andre, but the Great Spirit
hath no token of worth, except His bounteous
love and kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Andre could say nothing. He was
dumbfounded. He simply bowed Segwuna out,
overwhelmed by the startling revelations made by
this sagacious Indian prophetess.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Major Andre</span> went back to his desk, and sat
down for serious reflection.</p>

<p>He reasoned with himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here was a picture of Arnold and Barclugh.
How did this simple Indian maiden get such
knowledge of my secret affairs? She can have
no means of gaining this knowledge. She is
simply inspired.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next week, Andre could not dispel
the visions of Segwuna&#8217;s prophecy. He did not
dare to tell his friends, not even General Clinton,
for they would think him ridiculous. He was
naturally timid, and these words made him doubly
so. They made him hesitate more than once as to
what he ought to do. Whereas he was formerly
all enthusiasm about his plot with Arnold, he now
began to be doubtful and suspicious of his own
ability. The thought of the ire of the Great
Spirit of the Indian maiden being brought to bear
against the project that he had in hand worked
upon the fancy of Andre&#8217;s poetical nature and
unnerved him.</p>

<p>However, the Commander-in-Chief, General
Clinton, had ordered Andre to carry out these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
plans of ensnaring Arnold and taking West
Point by bribery, for it had been through the
correspondence started by Andre himself, that
Arnold was led into correspondence with the
enemy. The whole plan had to carry or fall
by the exertions of Andre&#8217;s own skill.</p>

<p>A letter was received by Major Andre at this
time which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">Phila., August 20, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir: I have heard from Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; about the
arrangements to sell you the goods that you spoke
of in your last favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has every detail arranged, but he must
meet you to make the contract in person. My
authority in the matter has now come to an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is still of opinion that his first proposal
is by no means unreasonable, and makes no
doubt, when he has a conference with you, that
you will close with it. He expects when you
meet that you will be fully authorized from your
house; that the risks and profits of the co-partnership
might be fully and clearly understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in behalf of Messrs. M&mdash;&mdash; and Co.</p>

<p><span class="gap">&#8220;Sir, Your Obedt. &amp; Hble. Servant,</span></p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<i>Gustavus</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. John Anderson, Merchant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>John Anderson answered the above letter.
Then, a few days thereafter, information was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
received from Gustavus, agreeing to meet him at
any convenient point, if he, John Anderson, would
make his way to the American outposts above
White Plains; that he would be secure under
the protection of Colonel Sheldon, who was
prepared to meet him.</p>

<p>Arnold had informed Colonel Sheldon that a
person was to come from New York, to the
latter&#8217;s quarters, whom he desired to meet for
the purpose of establishing a channel of secret
intelligence with New York.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Colonel Sheldon received the following
letter, which was so uncertain and enigmatical
that Colonel Sheldon despatched it at once
to General Arnold:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;New York, September 7, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am told my name is made known to you
and that I may hope your indulgence in permitting
me to meet a friend near your outposts. I will
endeavor to go out with a flag, which will be sent
to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry on Monday next, the 11th instant,
at twelve o&#8217;clock, where I shall be happy to meet
Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;. Should I not be allowed to go,
the officer who is to command the escort, between
whom and myself no distinction need be made,
can speak on the affair. Let me entreat you,
sir, to favor a matter so interesting to the parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
concerned, and which is of so private a nature
that the public on neither side can be injured
by it.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) John Anderson.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Colonel Sheldon,<br />
<span class="gap">Salem.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Sheldon was confused by the mention of an
officer taking the place of John Anderson, and
therefore sent the letter to Arnold, who tried
to explain the mysticisms in the letter to Colonel
Sheldon as best he could; and replied that he
would meet the flag and the gentleman himself
at Dobb&#8217;s Ferry.</p>

<p>Arnold also instructed his subordinate that if
he did not meet John Anderson, by any mishap,
word must be sent to headquarters of the
arrival of the gentleman within the lines, and that
John Anderson must be sent to his headquarters
with an escort of two or three horsemen.</p>

<p>Arnold went down the river in his barge as
far as King&#8217;s Ferry on the afternoon of the 10th
instant, and remained over night at the house
of Joshua H. Smith, who resided near the Ferry.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 11th instant,
Arnold proceeded by barge to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry for
the purpose of meeting Andre. An accident
prevented the interview. As Arnold was approaching
the destination, his barge was fired upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
by British gunboats and pursued closely enough
to endanger his life and possibly result in his
capture.</p>

<p>He landed, therefore, on the west or opposite
side of the river to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry, and went down
to the ferry landing, where he remained till night,
hoping to see Andre. At all events, he failed
to have a meeting on this journey.</p>

<p>The astonishing forecast of Segwuna had made
Andre over-cautious and timid. He did not choose
to hazard his mission by land to Colonel Sheldon.
He chose the safer communication by water.
He went to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry with Colonel Beverly
Robinson, and looked for Arnold to come in his
barge, but the firing upon the barge makes clear
why Arnold did not get to the rendezvous.</p>

<p>The timidity of Andre now explains the ultimate
failure of the plot. Arnold was obliged to explain
his public journey down the Hudson, by writing
to General Washington to the effect that guard
boats and signal lights were necessary precautions
to warn the country of the approach of the enemy
up the river.</p>

<p>The object of Segwuna&#8217;s visit to New York
had been accomplished. She had intimidated
Major Andre, and foiled the treachery of Arnold.
If the interview as first planned at Dobb&#8217;s Ferry
had taken place the recital of subsequent events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
would have been unnecessary.</p>

<p>Now complications arose. Every fresh move
that Arnold made required explanations as to
the movements of John Anderson. A second
attempt to have Andre meet with him by means
of the overland route was not considered favorably
by Andre. He would not attempt to meet Arnold,
except under the pretense of an exchange of flags.</p>

<p>The only way for General Arnold to successfully
accomplish his treachery was to meet Major
Andre personally, plan the surrender of West
Point and have his emoluments and rewards
guaranteed. He depended upon such a meeting
and was bold enough himself, but his first attempt
at Dobb&#8217;s Ferry was empty of results and he was
now thrown into cautious movements. He had
to explain to the Commander-in-Chief about
his public trip down the river; and the fact that
he had been fired upon and pursued by the enemy&#8217;s
gunboats gave notoriety to his whereabouts.
The failure of the Dobb&#8217;s Ferry interview must
rest upon Andre, for Arnold was truly bold
and fearless in his approach within the enemy&#8217;s
lines; Andre must have been intimidated by the
warning of Segwuna.</p>

<p>Arnold returned to his headquarters from
Dobb&#8217;s Ferry disappointed and nonplussed. He
wrote from Robinson House at once to Major Andre:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>&#8220;I have no confidant here. I have made one
too many already who has prevented some profitable
speculations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold&#8217;s anxiety for a meeting was now only
exceeded by that of the British, after the first
failure; so Arnold stated that he would send a
trusty person to the east side of Dobb&#8217;s Ferry,
Wednesday evening, September 20th, who would
conduct Major Andre to a place of safety where
a meeting between the principals could be held
without fear.</p>

<p>Arnold added:</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be necessary for you to be in disguise.
I cannot be more explicit at present. Meet me
if possible. You may rest assured that, if there
is no danger in passing your lines, you will be
perfectly safe where I propose a meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter was signed Gustavus and addressed
to John Anderson, Merchant.</p>

<p>However, before these instructions reached
Major Andre by Arnold&#8217;s secret messengers,
the British General Clinton became very anxious
and dispatched the Sloop-of-War Vulture on
the scene, with an emissary on board in the person
of Colonel Beverly Robinson, who was now in
the secret of the negotiations. He had also
accompanied Andre to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry when Arnold&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
barge had been fired upon. The Vulture proceeded
to Teller&#8217;s Point within view of the American
lines for the purpose of awaiting developments.</p>

<p>The unexpected, however, always happens
to hinder schemes. General Washington came
on a tour of inspection, at this juncture, and crossed
the Hudson at King&#8217;s Ferry in full view of the
Vulture soon after her arrival.</p>

<p>General Arnold came down, of course, from
his headquarters, Robinson House, to meet the
Commander-in-Chief in order to throw off any
suspicions surrounding his movements.</p>

<p>Washington and his suite crossed in Arnold&#8217;s
barge and as the Commander viewed the Vulture
through his glass and turned and spoke to his
suite in whispers it was noticed and commented
upon, subsequently, that Arnold blanched and
showed much concern.</p>

<p>While still in the boat, Marquis de la Fayette
turned to General Arnold and with a desire to
get information of the whereabouts of the French
fleet under Guichen, now approaching American
waters, and with no suspicions whatever upon
Arnold, pleasantly requested:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, since you have a correspondence
with the enemy, you must ascertain as soon
as possible what has become of Guichen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold immediately colored up and demanded:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>&#8220;Marquis de la Fayette, what do you mean by
asking me such a question?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question of Arnold was surprising and
uncalled for and he quickly recovered himself.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, the boat was nearing
shore and the anxiety to land interrupted the
incident. Arnold imagined that his scheme was
detected and that he was to be captured in the
boat.</p>

<p>Arnold went to Peekskill with Washington
and his party. The next day Washington went
to Hartford to meet the French Commander
and Arnold returned to West Point in his barge.</p>

<p>The British now desired to get into direct
communication with Arnold through Colonel
Robinson on the Vulture. Finesse had to be
used to deceive the watchful post-commanders
on the Hudson under the command of Arnold.
So, under the protection of a flag of truce from
the Vulture, Colonel Robinson sent a letter to
General Arnold asking the military to protect
his property since he had learned that his home
was to be confiscated by the State of New York
for his defection to the British cause.</p>

<p>General Arnold submitted the letter to his
Commander at Fishkill and in consequence
General Washington did not approve of the
proposal to have an interview with the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
concerning a purely legal affair.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief informed Arnold:</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a conference would afford grounds
for suspicion in the minds of some people and
I advise you to avoid it; the subject in which
Colonel Robinson is interested does not come
within the powers of a military officer and the
Civil Government of the State is the only authority
to which he can properly apply.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold now used the name of Washington to
answer Robinson&#8217;s letter. He, therefore, despatched
a boat openly to the Vulture, under an
officer and a flag.</p>

<p>Here came Arnold&#8217;s opportunity to give the
British all the information that he desired. The
answer was in two letters,&mdash;one sealed within the
other. The outer one gave Washington&#8217;s reply.
The inner one stated secretly that he would send
on the night of the 20th a person to Dobb&#8217;s
Ferry, or on board the Vulture. This person
would be furnished with a boat and a flag of truce.
He wished that the Vulture remain where she was
until the messenger reached her. The postscript
of the letter said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect General Washington to lodge here
on Saturday night next, and I will lay before
him every matter you may wish to communicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inside one also contained a copy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
letter heretofore sent to Andre to meet his messenger
on the east side of Dobb&#8217;s Ferry on the
evening of September 20th. This was the 19th,
and the three letters were despatched at once
to General Clinton in New York.</p>

<p>September 20th, Major Andre, having received
Arnold&#8217;s letters, pressed on to the Vulture and
arrived at seven o&#8217;clock in the evening instead of
remaining at Dobb&#8217;s Ferry as at first proposed.</p>

<p>Andre was all expectancy when he arrived on
board the sloop-of-war. He waited for Arnold
or his messenger, all night. The next day he
wrote General Clinton that he had made a second
appointment with no results. The interview
must be very soon or suspicions would be aroused
to upset the whole plan.</p>

<p>A ruse was now invented by Major Andre
to acquaint Arnold of his whereabouts. Some
parties had shown a flag of truce on shore to the
Vulture and a boat was sent to communicate with
them. When a boat with a flag from the Vulture
approached the shore it was fired upon from
ambush. This violation of the usage of warfare
was a subject for remonstrance. Therefore, a
letter was sent to General Arnold by Captain
Sutherland of the Vulture, claiming usage against
the code of civilized nations at war. The letter
was in the handwriting of Andre and signed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
&#8220;John Anderson, Secretary.&#8221; Here was the
information sought. Arnold immediately set
about the plan to bring Major Andre ashore for
an interview.</p>

<p>Joshua Hett Smith lived about two miles below
Stony Point, near the mouth of Haverstraw
Creek. He had boats and boatmen. He was
a confidant of Arnold and was engaged, upon
various occasions, to enter the enemy&#8217;s lines for
the Commander of West Point.</p>

<p>Arnold&#8217;s plan was finally fixed. He went
to Smith&#8217;s house and sent two boatmen with
Smith to bring a gentleman, named John Anderson,
from the Vulture to a point four miles below
Smith&#8217;s house, to a lonely spot on the banks of
the Hudson, in the darkness of midnight.</p>

<p>Arnold had provided Smith with three papers
signed by himself.</p>

<p>When the boat started from the mouth of
Haverstraw Creek it was past eleven o&#8217;clock and
the night was serene. The boat sped along
undiscovered until the lookout on the Vulture
hailed and ordered the men alongside. Smith
mounted the side and was immediately ordered
below.</p>

<p>There he met Captain Sutherland and Colonel
Robinson. The latter he knew personally, for
Robinson had been his neighbor on the Hudson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Smith handed over the papers from Arnold.
The cunning displayed by Arnold was portrayed
in these documents. Shielding himself from detection
he secretly intimated his desire to meet
Major Andre.</p>

<p>The first letter addressed to Colonel Robinson
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Headquarters, Robinson House,<br />
&#8220;September 21, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be delivered to you by Mr. Smith
who will conduct you to a place of safety. Neither
Mr. Smith nor any other person shall be made
acquainted with your proposals. If they (which
I doubt not) are of such nature that I can officially
take notice of them I shall do it with pleasure.
I take it for granted that Colonel Robinson will
not propose anything that is not for the interest
of the United States as well as himself.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) B. Arnold, M. Gen&#8217;l.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The next letter was to deceive the guard boats,
many of which were stationed along the Hudson
to intercept commerce with the enemy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Headquarters, Robinson House,<br />
&#8220;September 21, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit Mr. Joshua Smith to go to Dobb&#8217;s
Ferry with three men and a boy in a boat with
a flag, to carry some letters of a private nature
for a gentleman in New York, and to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
immediately, he having permission to go at such
hours and times as the tide and his business
suit.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) B. Arnold, M. Gen&#8217;l.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The third one conveyed the knowledge secretly
that Arnold wanted Major Andre to meet him
on shore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Headquarters, Robinson House,<br />
&#8220;September 21, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;This grants permission to Joshua Smith,
Mr. John Anderson and two servants to pass
and repass the guards at King&#8217;s Ferry, at all
times.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) B. Arnold, M. Gen&#8217;l.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>When the papers had been examined in the
cabin of the Vulture, Colonel Robinson excused
himself and returned in a little while with a gentleman
whom he introduced to Smith as Mr. John
Anderson. Smith and Anderson entered the boat
and were rowed to the point of rendezvous
arranged by Arnold with Smith. Arnold, concealed
in the shadow of the cliff, lay near
the river bank anxious for the boat to return
with Major Andre. The exact spot had been
agreed upon.</p>

<p>When the boat, which was heavy and cumbersome,
at length arrived, Smith scrambled up the
bank and found Arnold in the bushes. Smith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
returned and conducted Mr. Anderson to the
spot. Arnold requested Smith to leave them
to conduct their conversation privately.</p>

<p>Arnold looked around to be sure that Smith
was out of hearing when he extended his hand
to Major Andre, remarking in a subdued and
resigned tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, Major Andre, my hour of deliverance
has come! I hope no difficulties stand in the
way of our plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andre was more than eager for the exploit,&mdash;he
was rashly anxious. His voice showed evident
emotion when he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, we stand ready to carry
out our part. Can you surrender West Point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am able to surrender to your forces the stronghold
of our hopes, and end the war for the mother
country. It will be a blessing to my countrymen
and an everlasting benefit to the kingdom of
Great Britain. But, sir, how am I to be sure
that the promise made me by Roderick Barclugh
will be carried out?&#8221; was the reply given the
question of Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, I am the authorized representative
of His Britannic Majesty and for your
services to the King you are to be paid twenty
thousand pounds sterling, part of which has already
been advanced by Mr. Barclugh, and you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
to receive a commission as Brigadier-General
in His Majesty&#8217;s service. These emoluments
are dependent upon your accomplishment of your
own proposals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all correct, Major Andre,&#8221; returned
Arnold, &#8220;but how am I to realize these terms
if by chance you were to be killed or I was to be
detected in this business? My only safety is in
having the whole matter drawn up in the form of a
writing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we cannot do such things here in the dark,
General Arnold. You had better defer too much
formality for the sake of safety. You are dealing
with gentlemen,&#8221; argued Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;But governments have no gratitude,&#8221; retorted
Arnold, smarting under his experience with
Congress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, how can we write in these bushes?&#8221;
continued Andre. &#8220;I cannot see my hand.
I propose to get back to the ship from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use for haste in our conclusions
in this matter,&#8221; argued Arnold. &#8220;I have to
submit to you the plans of the works at West
Point, the disposal of the garrison, the time of
the attack and how you shall approach. I have
brought an extra horse and you can ride with
me to the house of Mr. Smith. I shall guarantee
you protection and safety in returning to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andre understood what it meant to prepare
for the details of this enterprise and at last he
reluctantly consented to go within the American
outposts as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall rely upon you as a gentleman to convey
me in safety to my lines. My commander has
instructed me not to enter your posts; but since
you insist upon an agreement in writing, I shall
have to comply with your plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Andre, you need not say these words
to me. I have been driven to this course by the
relentless attacks of those for whom I have done
the most. My heart went out at first to my
country, but now it has turned to stone. No
gratitude was shown me. I needed money and
from whom did I get it? I got it from my country&#8217;s
enemies. I needed sympathy for my wounds.
From whom did I get it? Not from my countrymen.
I needed encouragement to go out and
win more glory for our cause. Where did I get
it? Not from my country. Bah! These very
mountains taunt me for being a fool! My die
is cast and I am with you heart and soul. We
must succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak nobly, General Arnold,&#8221; insisted
Andre. &#8220;I am drawn to you irretrievably and
I am willing to run my risks along with yours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
I shall follow you even though my life were
in the balance.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture the conversation was interrupted
by the appearance of Smith from the boat,
who said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I believe that your time is drawing
near to daylight and I must leave this situation
with the boat. We must not be discovered in
this position by the guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words decided the case. When Arnold
and Andre realized their position and when
Smith informed them that the boatmen had
refused to return to the Vulture for fear of detection,
both of the conspirators mounted horses
and started for Smith&#8217;s house, which was four
miles distant by the road through Haverstraw
village.</p>

<p>Smith and the boatmen went by water to Haverstraw
Creek, where the boat was moored. At
his house Smith met Arnold and Mr. Anderson
who had already arrived just at daylight.</p>

<p>The three took breakfast together, since the
family of Joshua Smith had been previously
taken, by arrangements made beforehand, to
visit with their kinsfolk, the family of Colonel
Hay at Fishkill.</p>

<p>During the morning, in a room overlooking
Haverstraw Bay, Andre and Arnold secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
concluded the plans. Andre made the agreement
in writing with Arnold, and Arnold gave to Andre
a detailed description of the redoubts at West
Point and continued with a plan of attack for
a bloodless English victory.</p>

<p>But again the hand of Providence brings about
unexpected events. While these dealings were
concluding, they heard the booming of cannon
and saw the Vulture drop down stream out of
range of the battery posted by Colonel Livingston
to drive off the enemy&#8217;s ship.</p>

<p>Much concern now came over the principals
in this drama. Arnold reassured Andre by
stating that Mr. Smith would convey him by
boat or land through the American lines. Passports
from the Commanding-General would insure
safe convoy through the district under Arnold
and then when Andre reached the British outposts
he could manage himself.</p>

<p>Providing Major Andre with three passes
to meet all possible contingencies, as he thought,
and leaving him in the hands of Mr. Smith
as Mr. John Anderson, Arnold returned in his
barge soon after nine o&#8217;clock that morning,
to his headquarters to await the results of his
treachery.</p>

<p>Following are the passes provided for the
return of John Anderson, in Arnold&#8217;s own handwriting:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">&#8220;Headquarters, Robinson House,<br />
&#8220;September 22, 1780.</p>

<p>&#8220;Joshua Smith has permission to pass with
a boat and three hands and a flag to Dobb&#8217;s
Ferry on public business and to return immediately.</p>

guards to White Plains and to return, he being
on public business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Permit Mr. John Anderson to pass the guards
to the White Plains, or below, if he chooses,
he being on public business by my direction.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;(Signed) B. Arnold, M. Gen&#8217;l.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Andre passed the day in hiding, awaiting
impatiently for darkness to come that he might
be returned to the Vulture. But the more Andre
insisted, the more opposed Smith grew to the
route by boat. However, Smith won his point
for reasons not entirely logical, and after Andre
had exchanged his officer&#8217;s red coat for one of
Smith&#8217;s, and had wrapped himself up in a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
military coat with a cape, the two set out on
horseback, a little before sunset, accompanied by
a negro servant belonging to Smith.</p>

<p>The route lay across the Hudson at King&#8217;s
Ferry from Stony Point to Verplanck&#8217;s Point.
The party, after stopping over the first night,
proceeded successfully until they reached Pine
Bridge on the Croton River where Smith left
Andre to pursue his own course through the
neutral country.</p>

<p>Smith now returned to Robinson House and
reported to General Arnold where he had left
Mr. Anderson. Arnold seemed to be more than
pleased with the progress events were making
at this report. He felt sure of Andre reaching
King&#8217;s Bridge.</p>

<p>When Andre left Smith he also felt assured
of his success, for he rode boldly along until
he was near Tarrytown.</p>

<p>Here he was accosted by three men dressed in
the uniform of British soldiers.</p>

<p>Their story is best told in their own words.
Paulding, one of the three, said, when relating
the capture:</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself, Isaac VanWart, and David Williams
were lying by the side of the road about half a
mile above Tarrytown, and about fifteen miles
above King&#8217;s Bridge, on Saturday morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the 23rd of September. We had lain there
about an hour and a half, as near as I can recollect,
and saw several persons we were acquainted
with, whom we let pass. Presently one of the
young men who were with me said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There comes a gentleman-like looking man,
who appears to be well-dressed and has boots
on, and whom you had better step out and stop,
if you don&#8217;t know him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;On that I got up and presented my fire-lock
at the breast of the person and told him to stand,
and then I asked him which way he was going.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gentlemen,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I hope you belong
to our party.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What party?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said: &#8216;The lower party.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon that I told him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I do.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he said: &#8216;I am a British officer out of
the country on particular business, and I hope
you will not detain me a minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;To show that he was a British officer, he pulled
out his watch, upon which I told him to dismount.</p>

<p>&#8220;He then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;My God, I must do anything to get along.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seemed to make a kind of laugh of it
and pulled out General Arnold&#8217;s pass, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
was to John Anderson to pass all guards to White
Plains and below. Upon that he dismounted
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Gentlemen, you had best let me go or you
will bring yourselves into trouble, for your stopping
me will detain the General&#8217;s business. I am
going to Dobb&#8217;s Ferry to meet a person there
and get intelligence for General Arnold.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon that I told him I hoped he would
not be offended, that we did not mean to take
anything from him; and I told him there were
many bad people going along the road, and I
did not know but perhaps he might be one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paulding stated:</p>

<p>&#8220;If Andre had not declared himself a British
officer, when he produced General Arnold&#8217;s
pass I would have let him go. However, when
he pulled out his watch my suspicions were
further aroused.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three volunteers searched Andre, and
David Williams, one of the party, relates this
part of the story most minutely:</p>

<p>&#8220;We took him into the bushes,&#8221; said Williams,
&#8220;and ordered him to pull off his clothes, which
he did; but on searching him narrowly we could
not find any sort of writings. We told him to
pull off his boots which he seemed to be indifferent
about, but we got one boot off and searched in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
that boot and could find nothing. But we found
there were some papers in the bottom of his
stocking next to his foot, on which we made him
pull his stocking off and found three papers
wrapped up. Mr. Paulding looked at the papers
and said he was a spy. We then made him pull
off his other boot, and there were found three
more papers at the bottom of his foot within
his stocking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon this we made him dress himself and I
asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What will you give us to let you go?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will give you any sum of money.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you give us your horse, your saddle,
bridle, watch and one hundred guineas?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, and I will direct them to any place,
even this very spot, so that you can get them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you not give us more?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will give you any quantity of dry goods
or any sum of money, and bring it to any place
that you pitch upon, so that you may get it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Paulding answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, if you would give us ten thousand guineas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
you should not stir one step.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I then asked the person who called himself
John Anderson:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If it lay in your power, would you not get
away?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I would.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I do not intend that you shall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;While taking him along to the nearest post,
we asked him a few questions, and we stopped
under a shade. He begged us not to question
him and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When I come to any Commander I will
reveal all.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Andre and all of the papers found on him were
taken to North Castle and turned over to Lieutenant-Colonel
Jameson.</p>

<p>Jameson unwittingly sent Andre immediately
under a guard toward Arnold&#8217;s headquarters,
and despatched a note with the officer in charge
of the escort, to Arnold, stating that a certain
John Anderson was taken on his way to New
York. He also stated that certain papers found
in his stockings and which were of &#8220;a very dangerous
tendency,&#8221; had been forwarded to General
Washington.</p>

<p>The mistake made by Lieutenant-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Jameson was discovered by Major Tallmadge,
next in command, when the Major returned to
North Castle in the evening and heard the story
of the capture. Jameson was convinced of his
mistake in sending the prisoner but he would
not listen to the idea of not informing Arnold,
his Commanding General, of what had happened.
He did not suspect his superior in the least.</p>

<p>However, a messenger was despatched to overtake
the escort and to order the prisoner back
to North Castle, but to still forward the message
to Arnold&#8217;s headquarters. The fate of Arnold
now seemed problematical. But a chain of circumstances
favored the traitor.</p>

<p>Andre was ordered back and sent to Salem under
Major Tallmadge. A messenger was sent with
the guilty papers to intercept General Washington,
now on his way to West Point from Hartford,
and the first messenger was riding toward Robinson
House to inform Arnold of the capture of John
Anderson and the papers.</p>

<p>General Washington missed the messenger
because he returned on the road north of the one
on which the messenger was sent.</p>

<p>On the morning when Washington was due
at Robinson House to breakfast with Arnold,
two of the aides-de-camp of the Commander-in-Chief
were sent ahead to inform General Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
that the General was delayed because he wished
to inspect the redoubts across from West Point,
and not to wait breakfast. General Arnold
then sat down to breakfast with Mrs. Arnold and
the two aides.</p>

<p>During the progress of the meal a messenger
arrived and presented the Jameson despatches
to General Arnold.</p>

<p>Arnold read them and excused himself from
the table without a sign of excitement. He went
to Mrs. Arnold&#8217;s chamber and ordered a servant
to call Mrs. Arnold. When she came to him,
he hurriedly explained that his life depended
upon escape. She swooned in his presence
and he left her prostrate on the floor.</p>

<p>He went to the dining-room and stated to
the aides:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to go to West Point and prepare for
the arrival of the General.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then hurriedly mounted a horse of one of
the aides and dashed to the landing where his
barge was moored. Then ordering his men to
row with all their might, as he drew his pistols
and sat in the stern, he sped past the guard boats
with a flag and reached the British Sloop-of-War
Vulture, fifteen miles below Robinson House.</p>

<p>After introducing himself, he surrendered the
innocent boatmen to the British Commander and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
wrote a letter to General Washington asking
mercy for his wife.</p>

<p>After General Washington had inspected the
redoubts opposite West Point, he went with his
suite to Robinson House. Upon their arrival
they were informed that General Arnold had
been hurriedly called to West Point. Washington
ate his breakfast and started with all of his staff
except Colonel Hamilton. They took a barge
across the Hudson to the forts.</p>

<p>As Washington stood in the barge viewing the
highlands about him, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I am glad on the whole,
that General Arnold has gone before us, for we
shall now have a salute and the roaring of the
cannon will have a fine effect among these
mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>When no cannon was heard and they saw nobody
astir among the garrison, Washington exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Do they not intend to salute us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The General and his party landed and found
no one to greet them except the Commandant,
Colonel Lamb, who was very much surprised
to see his distinguished visitors.</p>

<p>Washington addressed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this, sir? Is not General Arnold
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the Commandant, &#8220;he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
not been here these two days, nor have I heard
from him within that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is extraordinary,&#8221; continued Washington.
&#8220;We were told that he crossed the river and that
we should find him here. However, our visit
must not be in vain. Since we have come, although
unexpectedly, we must look around a little and
see in what shape things are with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the forts and redoubts had been visited
and the garrison inspected, Washington and his
party returned to the barge and recrossed to the
Robinson House.</p>

<p>The letters and papers that had been forwarded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Jameson to General Washington
had followed the Commander-in-Chief
on the road to Hartford until it was learned that
the General had returned to West Point by the
upper road. Then the express retraced his
steps to Robinson House.</p>

<p>Colonel Hamilton was alone at Arnold&#8217;s headquarters
when the incriminating papers arrived
and immediately opened the despatches in the
absence of his chief at West Point. Here were
the papers found in Andre&#8217;s stockings and a
letter from Andre to Washington disclosing his
true character as Adjutant-General of the British
army and relating his entry within the American
lines, his departure therefrom in disguise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
his capture.</p>

<p>Upon the landing of General Washington and
his staff at the Robinson House from West
Point, Colonel Hamilton was seen to walk briskly
toward them, and when he spoke to Washington
in an undertone, they retired quickly together
into the house.</p>

<p>Here lay the exposure of the whole plot when
the papers were perused by Washington, but
too late to entrap the traitor. Arnold had gone
over to the enemy and had made his escape to
the Vulture. Andre was a prisoner at Salem
and had written a confession of the part that
he had played.</p>

<p>Mrs. Arnold had been left ignominiously by
the traitor, her husband, and in her distraction
she wept and raved alternately and accused
General Washington and Colonel Hamilton, when
they sought to console her, with a plot to murder
her child. Her lamentations were pitiable and
heart-rending in the agony of her despair. She
clasped her child to her breast as she stood in
the doorway of her chamber, hair dishevelled,
as she hurled the bitterness of a woman&#8217;s tongue
against those who, history tells us, held nothing
but the deepest sympathy for her misfortune.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Arnold returned to her father&#8217;s
home in Philadelphia and remained there until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
the Council of Philadelphia passed a resolution,
October 29th, as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Resolved:&mdash;that the said Margaret Arnold
depart this state within fourteen days from the
date hereof, and that she do not return again
during the continuance of the present war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Major Andre was conducted under guard,
to the vicinity of the Continental Army at Tappan.
He was there tried by a Court of Enquiry composed
of six Major-Generals and eight Brigadiers,
found guilty as a spy and condemned to be
executed.</p>

<p>Arnold and General Clinton attempted to save
Andre&#8217;s life on the ground that he had Arnold&#8217;s
pass. But as the pass was issued to John Anderson
it was void when applied to Major Andre.</p>

<p>Credit must be given Andre, however, that
he did not seek justification, personally, during
his trial for his acts under a flag or pass from
Arnold. He was reconciled to his fate and died
as a brave and honorable officer, dressed in the
full uniform of the Adjutant-General of the
British Army, at Tappan, October 2, 1780.</p>

<p>When Segwuna heard of the capture of Major
Andre and the exposure and flight of Benedict
Arnold, she thanked the Great Spirit for the
fulfillment of her prayers. She did not exult
in the downfall of the participants in this attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
crime against her native land, but she thanked
the Great Spirit for the exposure of their perfidy
and dishonesty. She now could explain to her
friends the part that was played by Barclugh
in this nefarious undertaking and if, then, her
duty had not been performed she could not help
it.</p>

<p>At the first announcement in New York about
the capture of Andre and the flight of Arnold,
Segwuna lost no time in retracing her steps to
Philadelphia.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;You</span> have been very quiet these past few
weeks, Miss Mollie. What has been the matter?
We have not seen you,&#8221; contended Miss Sallie
Redman, when she greeted Mollie at the Greydons&#8217;
party.</p>

<p>The old mansion at Dorminghurst was brilliantly
illuminated and the guests were fast arriving
in carriages, and passing up one side of the double
staircase and down the other.</p>

<p>People were beginning to come to Philadelphia
for the autumn session of Congress. The French
army had landed at Newport, and the French
fleet was fitting out for a demonstration against
New York or against some other stronghold of
the English. Enthusiasm among the Whigs was
running high. The Tories were beginning to
look with more favor upon independence. The
French minister M. de la Luzerne was the popular
lion of the hour, and anywhere that he was invited
was sure to be thronged with the dignitaries of
a new nation.</p>

<p>The Greydons began the social season for the
purpose of preparing society for the early announcement
of the engagement between Roderick Barclugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and their daughter. When the invitations
were first issued, the purpose was to announce
the engagement at this time, but Mollie would
not yet give her consent to Barclugh. Dr. Greydon
could see no reason, but Mollie was waiting
to see Segwuna. However, Dr. Greydon consulted
with his wife and decided that if the announcement
of the engagement could not be
made, a social function at Dorminghurst at
present would crystallize the enthusiasm of
the Whigs and bring the counsellors of the nation
together for an exchange of ideas and sentiments.</p>

<p>Mollie received with her mother and Dr.
Greydon when the guests came into the reception
room. She was beaming with good-nature but
when she saw Roderick Barclugh approaching
with the brilliant and haughty Miss Bessie Shippen
on his arm the color rose to her cheeks as Barclugh
shook Mollie&#8217;s hand and lingered long enough
to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;You charm me with your beauty and happiness
this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Shippen shook the hand of Mollie with
hauteur and looked at her gown with indifference;
and when she and Barclugh passed on through
the crowded rooms, she remarked bitterly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see why that young Quakeress turns
the men so crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>&#8220;Because she has sense, beauty and no guile
in her heart,&#8221; retorted Barclugh snappily.</p>

<p>Miss Shippen exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Shippens, the Redmans, and the Chews
were there among the chief representatives of
the Tory sentiment. They congregated in groups
by themselves and seemed to feel that their
sentiments were not popular, when they saw
the brilliant assemblage of Whigs from every
state, conversing about the topics of the hour.</p>

<p>General Schuyler from New York was talking
to M. de la Luzerne, the French minister, about
the campaign, spiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;This arrival of the French troops and the
fleet at Newport has given us new life, M. de la
Luzerne,&#8221; explained General Schuyler. &#8220;General
Washington has gone to Hartford to meet Count
de Rochambeau. Our committee expect to hear
from him at West Point on his return. The
campaign is expected to take on an active turn
if Clinton moves out of New York,&#8221; concluded
the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, General Schuyler,&#8221; returned
the French minister suavely. &#8220;By the way,
General, did I ever tell you how Arnold wanted
to borrow money from me on account of his
importance and influence in affairs?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>&#8220;Why, no. Do tell it,&#8221; insisted the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is strictly <i>entre nous</i>, General,&#8221; related
the minister. &#8220;Arnold wanted a loan from the
French government and I quickly told him:
&#8216;You desire of me a service which would be easy
for me to render, but which would degrade us
both. When the envoy of a foreign power gives,
or if you will, lends money, it is in order to corrupt
those who receive it, and to make them the creatures
of the sovereign whom he serves; or rather,
he corrupts without persuading; he buys and does
not secure. But the firm league entered into
between the King and the United States is the
work of justice and the wisest policy. It has
for its basis a reciprocal interest and good-will.
In the mission, with which I am charged, my
true glory consists in fulfilling it without intrigue
or cabal, without resorting to any secret practices,
and by the force alone of the conditions of the
alliance,&#8217;&#8221; concluded M. Luzerne.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo, bravo, M. Luzerne. That Arnold
has given our committee much concern and
trouble. He is a brilliant leader, but he has no
sense of propriety or diplomacy,&#8221; asserted General
Schuyler, who left the minister as he seemed to
be holding a small reception of his own,&mdash;so many
people pressed around him to say a word about
the arrival of the French troops and fleet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>The music and dancing were going on in the
large rooms across the great hallway from the
reception room. Mollie was there holding court,
entertaining a group of the younger men with
her brilliant repartee.</p>

<p>Family representatives of the members of
Congress from the South were there;&mdash;each family
coming in an equipage of its own.</p>

<p>The minuet was danced in its stateliest fashion;
Miss Greydon and Roderick Barclugh, Sally
Chew and Mr. Carroll, Miss Hancock and Mr.
Custis, Miss Schuyler and Richard Henry Lee,
formed the set. As the music swelled in rhythmic
measure, the richly gowned mademoiselles and
the bachelors, scions of the most distinguished
families, tiptoed and curtsied through the sinuous
changes of the dance, to the entire approbation
of the critical assemblage.</p>

<p>Mollie was showered with attentions and compliments,
some even going as far as to hint slyly
at the attentions of Roderick Barclugh. Mr.
Livingston of New York saw the minuet and
noticed Roderick Barclugh dancing with the
daughter of the host. He turned to Charles
Thomson, the Secretary of Congress, and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Thomson, who is this gentleman, Mr.
Barclugh? I have heard his name, but I never
saw him before. Where does he come from to us?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>Mr. Thomson, who was always very reserved,
replied quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was introduced to us by a letter from
Benjamin Franklin, who in turn was asked to
give him the letter by the French Monarch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Livingston then remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the French Secretary must then know
his antecedents. Ah, here is M. Marbois. We&#8217;ll
ask him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Marbois, do you know who this gentleman,
Roderick Barclugh, is?&#8221; questioned Mr. Livingston.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the Secretary pleasantly. &#8220;He
is the second son of Sir George Barclugh, who
resided, when living, upon his estates in England.
I have heard that he has been engaged in secret
missions of diplomacy. But I do not know what
interest brings him to Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; continued the member
of Congress. &#8220;I have understood that he is
paying attentions to Miss Greydon. I was anxious
to know his antecedents.&#8221;</p>

<p>When this conversation was taking place between
the French Secretary and Mr. Livingston,
General Schuyler went over to the latter gentleman
and touched him on the arm. The General
was deathly pale and immediately the two went
to a remote part of the house and held a hurried
consultation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Livingston,&#8221; said the General. &#8220;The
news has just reached the city that General
Arnold has gone over to the enemy and Major
Andre, Adjutant-General of the British Army,
is a prisoner in the hands of General Washington,
and that our cause has just escaped a terrible
calamity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Livingston. &#8220;Has Arnold
gone over to the enemy? And you and I had
just pleaded with the Commander to give him
West Point! What did he attempt to do?&#8221;
questioned Livingston excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he planned to surrender West Point,&#8221;
answered the General.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; cried Livingston. &#8220;We must
leave at once. We cannot tell what may happen,
or whom to trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two members of the Committee on Military
Affairs of Congress hastily found the host and
gave the news to him and left for the city together.</p>

<p>The news soon spread throughout the house,
and animated groups were collected, discussing
the news.</p>

<p>Mollie was talking to Barclugh and Mrs.
White, the Rector&#8217;s wife, when Sally Milling
came up to the group and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard the news that has just reached
the city?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>&#8220;No, what is it?&#8221; asked the other three, almost
in unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, General Arnold has gone over to the
enemy, and Major Andre is a prisoner in the
hands of General Washington, and a plot has
been unearthed to surrender West Point to the
British!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh stood as though stricken
with paralysis. His face became ashen white.
He tried to speak but his voice failed him.</p>

<p>Mollie Greydon and the other two ladies looked
at Barclugh for an instant and then Mollie stepped
toward him as she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Mr. Barclugh? Are you
ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. It is nothing,&#8221; muttered Barclugh.
&#8220;You will excuse me, ladies. I had better
retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roderick Barclugh went to the table where
refreshments were served and after partaking
of a glass of punch, he sought his hostess and
Miss Mollie, then left in his carriage for his lodgings.</p>

<p>As soon as the Shippens heard the news they
retired precipitately, for the information was
too crushing to wait for any formalities.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the excitement that ran
through the large and brilliant assemblage at
the Greydons&#8217;. Even the music and the minuet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
could not keep the guests from a discussion of
all the Arnold family troubles for the past two
years. Everybody was so astounded that a gloom
was cast over the social pleasures of the evening.
At last a general leave-taking was in order and
the last carriage rolled down the avenue of hemlocks
at half past twelve o&#8217;clock.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIX</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the party was over, Dr. Greydon went
up to Mollie and taking her by the hands, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mollie, my child, you looked your best to-night.
I felt very proud. Now, you must take your
rest. The excitement of this evening has been
very hard for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true, papa dear, but can you not let
us talk over a few of the events of the evening?
That is the best part of an evening affair,&mdash;to
talk over what people said and what happened,&#8221;
contended Mollie, when she sat down to rehearse
the evening&#8217;s events in girlish fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity it was that the news arrived about
General Arnold just in the midst of the gayest
part of the evening,&#8221; continued Mollie bubbling
over with the animation of youth. &#8220;What a fine
minuet Mr. Barclugh can dance! I was more
than delighted! But did you see how pale he
became when he heard about General Arnold?
And did you see how the Shippens took the news?
It was awful! Well, everybody will remember
this party from the tragic episodes caused by the
Arnold treason!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, there, there, Mollie, you are too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
worked up. You must give yourself rest and
repose for we can not tell what the morrow will
bring forth in these stirring times,&#8221; insisted Dr.
Greydon, as he went up to Mollie and took
her by both hands and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mollie, you must have rest,&#8221; reiterated
her mother, as Mollie went to her and kissed her
good-night.</p>

<p>But no sooner had Mollie departed than very
serious matters presented themselves for discussion
between Dr. Greydon and his wife about their
only daughter.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon arose and taking his wife by the
hand, said in his most tender tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Martha, my dear, we have astounding revelations
to discuss, and I wish that you would come
into my office and there go over the matter with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, William,&#8221; assented Mrs. Greydon.
&#8220;I hope that it is not very bad news,&#8221; she continued
as she took Dr. Greydon&#8217;s arm and both went
to the office in the south elevation of the quadrangle
of buildings.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon led the way to the office and
conducted his wife to a large easy-chair, when
he sat down at his desk and began to discuss
the important matters on his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Martha, our Segwuna returned from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
New York to-night and came to my office. She
brought me the news about General Arnold and
Major Andre. She also informed me that our
Mr. Barclugh has been the secret agent of the
British in Philadelphia, and has been in secret
communication with General Clinton for the
purpose of carrying out Arnold&#8217;s plot,&mdash;the surrender
of West Point to the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! Mr. Barclugh, the agent of the British!&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the <i>agent</i> of the British! He had offered
General Arnold twenty thousand pounds sterling
and a Brigadier-Generalship in the English
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what perfidy,&#8221; cried Mrs. Greydon.
&#8220;How does Segwuna know these things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She followed Mr. Barclugh to New York
and saw him with Major Andre and General
Clinton. She learned much while nursing him
during his case of the <i>peste</i>; and finally she went
to New York and interviewed Major Andre,
who showed his concern at what Segwuna knew
of the plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna brought the news of the failure of
the plot to me to-night. I did not mention it
because I wished to have the news confirmed
and I did not wish to spoil Mollie&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, dear Martha, what shall I do about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
affair for Mollie&#8217;s sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would first be sure that the story of Segwuna
is true. If it is true, I have no fears about what
Mollie herself would say,&#8221; contended Mrs. Greydon
in her practical way. &#8220;Mollie has not yet
consented to marry Mr. Barclugh. She informed
me so this morning. She promised Segwuna
not to do so until her return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless Segwuna!&#8221; exclaimed Dr. Greydon.
&#8220;Our daughter is safe from the disgrace of this
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My advice, William,&#8221; argued Mrs. Greydon,
&#8220;is to go to Mr. Barclugh and ask him if these
statements are true. If he loves our daughter
he will tell the truth. If he tells the truth and
admits his guilt, on account of our daughter&#8217;s
love for him we will save him from exposure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will our Mollie take this affair?
I believe that she loves Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; asked
Dr. Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be but one way for Mollie,&#8221; insisted
her mother. &#8220;I will explain all to Mollie in the
morning. You can see Segwuna and question
her further and then we will have it decided in
your office to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Martha,&#8221; concluded Dr. Greydon.
&#8220;We must not continue this discussion
longer to-night,&#8221; as he offered his arm to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Greydon, and conducted her to her apartments
and fondly kissed her good-night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning Segwuna met Dr. Greydon
in his office at nine o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon questioned the Indian maiden
at length about the plot, and she told the story
precisely as before.</p>

<p>Mollie, with evidences of severe weeping and
intense mental anguish written upon every line
of her face, entered her father&#8217;s office with her
mother. She at once ran to Segwuna and embraced
her and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My Segwuna, you did all of this for me. How
shall I ever repay you? How sorry I am for
Mrs. Arnold. I might now have been placed
in a similar position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest Mollie,&#8221; began Dr. Greydon
tenderly. &#8220;How do you feel about Mr. Barclugh&#8217;s
proposal for my daughter&#8217;s hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; answered Mollie firmly, &#8220;I can
never love the enemies of my country, especially
those who fight her institutions by means of
subterfuge and corruption. My love has been
shocked. He knew my patriotism and he encouraged
it; but he hoped to win me and bind
me by the holy ties of marriage. My heart is
broken. I can never consent, if he is an enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>&#8220;But, father, do not expose him. It would
cost him his life and I know he loves me. Spare
his life for my sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words settled the matter to the evident
satisfaction of both Dr. Greydon and Segwuna.</p>

<p>Mollie and her mother left the office for the
other part of the house, and the Doctor and
Segwuna took the carriage for Philadelphia and
Roderick Barclugh&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon walked into the office of Roderick
Barclugh and confronted him when he was busy
with his clerk in the outer room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh,&#8221; began Dr. Greydon. &#8220;May
I see you privately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Barclugh, as he led the
way to his private office and left Segwuna in the
outer room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, sir,&#8221; said Dr. Greydon, sternly,
&#8220;that you have been the secret agent of the British
in our midst, you, who have asked my daughter
for marriage. Now, sir, is that statement true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By what authority do you make those statements,
Dr. Greydon?&#8221; parried Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask you as a gentleman, Mr. Barclugh,
who has extended the courtesies of his home
to you, to answer a direct question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you would not ask me to incriminate
myself, Dr. Greydon?&#8221; replied Barclugh hesitatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>&#8220;No, sir. If you are guilty, for the sake of
my daughter&#8217;s former love for you, you may
leave our country. If you insist on not answering
I shall let you be apprehended,&#8221; insisted Dr.
Greydon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what proofs have you that I am concerned
in this affair?&#8221; asked Barclugh.</p>

<p>Dr. Greydon stepped to the door and called
Segwuna to their presence, as he asked her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Segwuna, what proof have you that Mr.
Barclugh is concerned in this treason?&#8221;</p>

<p>Segwuna took from the inner pocket of her
waist and placed in Dr. Greydon&#8217;s hands the
envelope containing the letter brought to Roderick
Barclugh by the Swedish fisherman.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is sufficient,&#8221; exclaimed Barclugh, &#8220;I
am the arch-conspirator, Doctor Greydon. I
am at your mercy. I have been unjust to ask
your daughter in marriage. If you allow me to
escape with my life, I shall return to England
and teach my countrymen that Americans can
not be corrupted. I will do more for the cause
of your country than armies or alliances. I
owe my life to you and I pledge myself to do a
duty that I owe to a true American gentleman.
I will try to convince my government of the justice
of your cause.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>Turning to Segwuna, Barclugh said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved my life, Segwuna, and you also
foiled my plot. The loss of that letter during
my illness made us too cautious in dealing with
Arnold. We knew that some one had the information
and we were fearful of entering the
American lines since some one knew our scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not I,&#8221; returned Segwuna, &#8220;Mr.
Barclugh, that foiled your plot. It was the Great
Spirit that laid you low with the <i>peste</i> and put
the correspondence into my hands. God hates
a corruptionist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barclugh fled at once upon the retirement
of Segwuna and Dr. Greydon from his office.
He precipitately left on the sloop of the faithful
Swedes with all the ready money that he had.</p>

<p>He reached New York and went to General
Clinton.</p>

<p>General Clinton withdrew from the Beekman
House when the news of the execution of Major
Andre reached him. He now lived at Number 1
Broadway, where he could be in constant touch
with the stirring affairs of his command since
the death of his beloved Andre.</p>

<p>Arnold came to New York and took up his
quarters at the King&#8217;s Arms Tavern, Number 9
Broadway. Here he lived and entertained
the belief that the British cause was invincible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
He began plans to bring success to the royal
arms.</p>

<p>He prepared and issued an address, &#8220;To the
Inhabitants of America,&#8221; a long and labored
article justifying his treachery. Then, a few
days thereafter, he issued a proclamation entitled,
&#8220;To the officers and soldiers of the Continental
army who have the real interests of their country
at heart and who are determined to be no longer
the dupes of Congress or of France.&#8221; It was
simply an offer of bribery to the Americans to
desert their cause; but there were no responses.
A few loyalists rallied around his standard,&mdash;those
who were seeking officers&#8217; positions in the
British army. His mercenary spirit was expressed
in this appeal.</p>

<p>In the midst of these circumstances, Roderick
Barclugh arrived from Philadelphia. His first
sight when he walked into the King&#8217;s Arms
Tavern was that of General Arnold pacing up
and down before the fireplace in the tap-room.</p>

<p>Arnold looked up and beheld with astonishment
the tall and athletic form of Barclugh. Until
now Arnold never had quaked before mortal
man; but when the piercing glance of Barclugh
met his gaze, a culprit shivering like a whipped
dog was all that stood before Barclugh.</p>

<p>Had the spirit of Washington appeared in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
path, Arnold could not have been more abject.
His tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. His
eyes lost all power of vision and rolled nervously,
as though hunted, in their sockets. Pitiable,
indeed, in his moral transgression, stood the man
once the pride of the patriot army, before one whose
only claim to distinction was the gold that he
could control.</p>

<p>Barclugh was amazed at Arnold&#8217;s collapse.
He felt guilty and powerless, himself. The love
of Mollie Greydon had saved his life; he knew
that his gold could never have done so. Yet
Barclugh felt that he must not relinquish his
power over the traitor, so he addressed him
harshly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have ruined us all, Arnold. I am thankful
to be here alive. The stain of Andre&#8217;s blood
will always remain upon your escutcheon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The traitor, nervous and guilty, looked around
the tap-room, and whispered into Barclugh&#8217;s
ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;We better discuss our matters more privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold now led the way to his chamber and
there the two faced each other.</p>

<p>Arnold began anxiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Barclugh, have you heard of my wife and
child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No news, Arnold,&#8221; replied the financier.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>&#8220;Well, what is to become of her? I am dying
by inches from anxiety. I would be willing to
give up all for her safety,&#8221; wailed the traitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, don&#8217;t whine about losses from your
unfulfilled contract,&#8221; continued Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! do I not even get my money?&#8221; exclaimed
Arnold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a farthing more, if I can help it,&#8221; retorted
the moneyed man.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221; asked the
General.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s business to do with an affair of honor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An affair of honor?&#8221; queried Barclugh. &#8220;You
left your honor behind when you accepted money
and agreed to perform your treachery and receive
the balance when the job was successfully done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see, Barclugh, I have the agreement
of Major Andre to cover just such an emergency
as this,&#8221; exclaimed Arnold as he struck with
exultation his breast pocket in which he had
his writing signed by Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that may or may not be so, Mr. Arnold.
You will now have to settle your bargain made with
Major Andre, with General Clinton. Major
Andre is dead. I represent the men of substance
and I am not at liberty to recklessly squander
their money in a way that is not warranted,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
contended the envoy of the Bank Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; concluded Arnold, who was
now aware of the cold blood of a financial agent
when the deal fell through. &#8220;We shall go to
General Clinton and have this matter settled.
I demand that you go with me. If I am not given
satisfaction for the sacrifices that I have undergone,
I will publish my agreement made with
Andre. The world will call you a pack of scoundrels,
to deceive an honest man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scoundrels!&#8221; exclaimed Barclugh. &#8220;You better
ask what your friends will say as to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold and Barclugh walked to the headquarters
of General Clinton, Number 1 Broadway. A
few steps took the two up the staircase to the
front entrance and then they were ushered into
the presence of the English Commander.</p>

<p>None of the three men was in a humor to talk
very much, especially Barclugh. After an exchange
of formal greetings, General Arnold
commenced the discussion:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Clinton, I must know where I stand
in my financial matters and in my official position
before Mr. Barclugh leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you know I promised to turn
over West Point to your command and my compensation
was to have been twenty thousand
pounds sterling and a commission as Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
in the British army, but the fortunes
of war have turned against us. I am here under
your protection with nothing to insure my recompense
except my compact with Major Andre.</p>

<p>&#8220;General Clinton, shall I receive the recompense
due me or shall I be treated with ingratitude such
as I have received from the Colonial Congress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold,&#8221; replied Sir Henry Clinton,
&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s government certainly shall not
dishonor its obligations, but we cannot be asked
to pay the full amount that was promised when
the transaction was entered into. For those
conditions depended upon the success of your
enterprise. We shall have to limit the payment
to ten thousand pounds sterling, less what has
been advanced to you by Mr. Barclugh. Mr.
Barclugh has already advanced you about four
thousand pounds, so that your balance will be
about six thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will receive a commission of Brvt. Brig.
General and its regular pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, General Arnold, do you believe that we
can win our cause now that we have failed in our
enterprise against West Point?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no question in my mind,&#8221;
returned Arnold, now that he had been assured
of his allowance and his commission. &#8220;We can
raise a force and take West Point by regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
attacks. I shall prepare plans and submit them
to you for approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; continued Arnold, &#8220;the Colonies can
not hold out against the resources of Great Britain.
We must fight until the tide of victory turns our
way. We cannot afford to lose. We must win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about the situation, Mr.
Barclugh?&#8221; asked General Clinton, turning to
the special agent of His Majesty&#8217;s government,
graciously.</p>

<p>Barclugh drew himself up to his full height
and said bitterly, for he felt that both of the men
before him had made a mess of his plans:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, if you want my candid opinion,
I am forced to say that you will not conquer the
American Colonists if you fight from now until
doomsday. They are simple, fearless people,
liberty-loving and self-sacrificing. They have no
need of money. They live next to nature and
fight and exist wholly within their own resources.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mission to the Colonies has been made
utterly unsuccessful since our plot failed. One
cannot understand the temper of the people
until he has lived among them as I have. The
mothers and maidens, as well as the men, are
fighting for their land. There may be a few
malcontents among them, like our new friend here
(pointing over his shoulder with his thumb toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Arnold), but they are only loud talkers and boasters,
and carry no weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arnold scowled at Barclugh, and General
Clinton&#8217;s ire began to gather force when the
color mounted into his thick neck and his wine-flushed
face, as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What! do you mean to tell <i>me</i>, sir, that His
Majesty&#8217;s armies can never conquer the Colonies?
Impossible! Sir, impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I mean,&#8221; responded Barclugh
coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to imply, sir, that the forces
under the command of General and Sir Henry
Clinton, K. B., are not able to carry out the King&#8217;s
commands?&#8221; demanded General Clinton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; replied Barclugh dryly, &#8220;that both
General and Sir Henry Clinton, K. B., are very
much deluded personages as to the task before
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Clinton now turned and bowed to
Roderick Barclugh and, with lips firmly compressed,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barclugh, I have done with your information.
I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Sir Henry remarked as he took Arnold&#8217;s
arm in his own:</p>

<p>&#8220;General Arnold, we better retire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two generals, in oppressive silence, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
turned their backs on Barclugh and stalked out
of the room.</p>

<p>Barclugh stood and watched their departure.
He dropped his head in silent reflection. Raising
his eyes, the pent-up fire of an indignant soul
shone out of them. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them go! The hirelings of kingly power
as I have been! They plan to flatter the King
and consider as a reward only the gold that they
receive.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well that kings have gold for their use.
For the bones that they throw to their dogs would
soon play out, unless the dry bones that are
rattled scare the whelps.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mission has failed! Why? The Americans
are superior to the system that makes hirelings
of us all. No system of finance affects them.
They refused my gold. Mutual trust in each
other, as men, made their pieces of commissary
paper as useful as my gold. Of all the men
that I met, Arnold was the only one that I could
convince with an Englishman&#8217;s argument, pounds
sterling. American manhood is a product of
American soil. It has grown out of the forests
and the streams. It is incorruptible. If its
ideals are lost in the greed for gold, the debased
have to flee America and seek an asylum, like
Arnold, in the bosom of the Englishman where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
pounds sterling can outweigh character and
manhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I return to England. I give them back their
accursed gold, and show them that though Englishmen
may think like Warren Hastings, that the
souls of men are expressed in pounds sterling
according to their stations, yet in one place in
this world manhood stands above guineas,
and AMERICAN MANHOOD HAS NOT ITS
PRICE!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XL</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We now</span> come to the home affairs of Barclugh.
He returned to England after his interview in New
York.</p>

<p>Arnold was not successful in his enterprises
after his failure to surrender West Point. He
ravaged towns in Connecticut and in Virginia,
as a British Brigadier, with fiendish delight,
and history tells us that he led anything but
a happy existence in England; and at last, died
in seclusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unwept, unhonored and unsung.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Andre! He was the victim of the ambition
of youth. His superiors depended on his
ability to do extraordinary things; however, his
nature was too guileless to cope with the daring
of a man like Arnold. He ought never to have
gone into the American lines. To have met
Arnold secretly again at their rendezvous would
have been an easy matter. His superior, Clinton,
gave him explicit instructions not to enter the
American outposts; but Arnold&#8217;s headlong rashness
led him into danger and he paid the penalty with
his life.</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle, the British Commissioner, returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
to England and history tells us that he
became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and
sank into oblivion. He and George Selwyn
were the prime movers in the plot, the purpose
of which was to get funds from government
with which to square the losses of Fox at the
gaming-table.</p>

<p>Barclugh, however, though the main actor in
the plot to hold America within the sphere of
kingly and aristocratical government, was, by
his actual experience among the Americans of all
classes, convinced that their position was invincible
on the principles of free and representative government.
He could see that even though the British
were to get the seaports along the Atlantic and
hold them, the sturdy pioneers would retire into
the mountains and fight until exterminated.
Then the French Coalition gave England an
enemy in the front and rear. He could see the
end. He thought best to conclude the war, and,
at least, save the Canadas to the mother country.</p>

<p>Convinced with these conclusions he went to
Mr. Prince, the Governor of the Bank of England,
and made his report. The principal arguments
were:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the eight years of the war the population
increased nearly one million souls.</p>

<p>&#8220;The British and Hessian soldiery desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
to take up free homes on the new lands of America.</p>

<p>&#8220;The land is productive of every necessity
in abundance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Americans leave their plows to fight
one day and then return to them, to provide
subsistence the next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money appeals to very few of them. None
except a few merchants in the seaports care for
money. Merchandise receipts issued by the government
pass as legal tender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their depreciated currency does not affect
them. They have no banks. They all have
faith in their cause and in their ability to redeem
their obligations when the war ends. Therefore,
each one stands ready to sacrifice his life and
his substance for his principles.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mr. Prince received these tidings he
knew that they were reliable and he merely
concluded:</p>

<p>&#8220;The war must stop before we lose all. But,&#8221;
he prophesied, &#8220;in less than one hundred years
hence, England will subdue the Americans with
her system of finance and her system of aristocratic
society. An Englishman&#8217;s title will not then
go begging in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Lord George Germaine received the
report from the Governor of the Bank of England
and Lord North received it, and, at last, the King&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
inner circles of government were astounded.</p>

<p>Following closely upon these events came
the news of Cornwallis&#8217;s surrender, and Lord
North made his famous exclamation:</p>

<p>&#8220;O God! It is all over!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollie Greydon</span> could not arise on the
morning after the interview between her father
and Roderick Barclugh. She sank into a low
fever and for two months she lingered between
life and death while being nursed by her faithful
friend, Segwuna. In her delirium she talked about
the Assembly at the French Ministers and oft
repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;The dance is the language of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she would see the horses galloping down
the road beside the Delaware where she outdistanced
Roderick Barclugh on her thoroughbred,
&#8220;Prince.&#8221;</p>

<p>She would pass her hand over the bed-covering
and pat it with such a loving and gentle touch
as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Noble Prince, noble Prince, you are such a
fine horse, Prince. If he does not love me, you
do, don&#8217;t you, Prince?</p>

<p>&#8220;You were naughty, Prince, to run away from
him that day. If I had only let him say what was
in his heart that day, I would have been so happy.
Yes, I would have been so happy! so happy!&#8221;
And Mollie went to sleep from mere exhaustion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>Segwuna and Mollie&#8217;s mother were seated
beside her canopied bed and their eyes filled with
tears as they watched the darling of their hearts
suffering such anguish. It can come to one only
once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>Many times Doctor Greydon and Mrs. Greydon
held lengthy consultations when the disease took
its insidious hold on the now wasted frame of
their beautiful daughter. It was such a delicate
thread that held all that was dear to them on
earth. The image of little Mollie, their only
darling child, as she gladdened their souls with
her childish prattle passed through their minds.
For hours at a time, they would sit and watch
silently at the bedside and in silence pray to the
One that knows the hearts of all: &#8220;to deliver from
our midst the Dread Messenger that hovers
over our child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Greydon would sometimes tearfully say:
&#8220;William, maybe it was all for the best that
Mr. Barclugh came to us, for God can send him
back as a messenger from our Colonies and tell
the truth to our cousins beyond the sea. That
is what Segwuna says and she is almost endowed
with the intelligence of the supernatural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, my dear, if Mr. Barclugh is the
gentleman that I think he will tell the truth,
and how our child would rejoice in any good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
that he could do for our country. I would give
almost any personal sacrifice if I could restore
my little Mollie to her strength. Yes, I would
give up my own life for hers,&#8221; and the great,
strong patriot turned his head and his voice
choked and the noble heart of the man was overcome
with his emotions.</p>

<p>The long days and the longer nights of the vigil
for the dear one dragged along and along and
the father and the mother seemed to age perceptibly
under the strain. But Segwuna never
lost her hope. She would say in her sweet voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Spirit of Segwuna&#8217;s fathers will
watch over our little one and bless her days with
happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The malady had its course and one morning
Mollie awoke and said in a whisper, for she was
very weak:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mama, where have I been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been sleeping sweetly, my dear,&#8221;
replied the mother softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I had such a sweet dream. I saw his
face, and he looked at me with such kindly eyes,&#8221;
came from Mollie as though an angel were speaking,
and she closed her eyes and smiled as though
she were an infant again.</p>

<p>&#8220;God be praised,&#8221; whispered her mother.
&#8220;My darling girl may be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>Now the days seemed brighter and the nights
shorter. Mollie began to gather strength. In
a week she was able to see her father and
talk to him for five minutes while she held his
hand in hers.</p>

<p>In three weeks she was able to drive in the
carriage on mild days. But her heart seemed
heavy. She watched for the mail. She thought
that he could not have given her up without a
word. Weeks grew into months and the spring
came and the summer passed yet no word from
the one she knew was dearer to her than life.</p>

<p>But on a bright day in October, nearly a year
from the time when Mollie was taken ill, a large,
brawny man approached the portico where Mollie
was seated, and raising his hat, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Dorminghurst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter here for Miss Greydon.&#8221; And
the hardened hand of the man placed a packet
in Mollie&#8217;s fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it is from Mr. Barclugh!&#8221; exclaimed
Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it, sir?&#8221; asked Mollie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought it from the inlet on the Jersey
coast. It came from New York by sloop,&#8221;
answered the man, who was one of the fishermen
Barclugh had employed when he fled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>&#8220;Are there any fees, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever. I was charged to deliver
it into the hands of Miss Mollie Greydon. I have
done so and my duty ends. Good day. I must
return,&#8221; was the short and unceremonious message
of the boatman and he left as mysteriously as
he came.</p>

<p>But here it was, the word from Roderick
Barclugh at last: A large package emblazoned
with a crest and the motto standing out in strong
contrast:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Post Nubes Lux&#8221;</p>

<p>Mollie opened it with nervous hand and she
gazed at the bold handwriting of Roderick Barclugh
with an anxious face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">Devon Court, Devonshire,<br />
August 17, 178&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Madam:</p>

<p>&#8220;True to my pledge to your honored father
I have changed my attitude toward the Colonies.
Mostly from your precious lips I have learned to
love your country and the principles that they
are struggling to maintain. I am happy to inform
you that the Colonies will very soon be free and
independent States. The report that I have
made to my superiors is enclosed and the conclusion
has been made according to the information in
my report that a war of extermination is impracticable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and that England will honor the
Colonies to establish which she has contributed
the best blood in her realm and will wish them
Godspeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now as to my part in the unfortunate drama
of Arnold&#8217;s treason I can only say: &#8216;Forget it
and forgive me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had succeeded my only desire was to share
with you the honors that I might have claimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Madam, I love you with all my soul.
Your affection is more to me than my country,
my title, or even my life. If you would only
consent to be my wife I will go whithersoever
thou sayest or do whatsoever thou biddest. Be
mine and we will be forever happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since my return to England my older brother
has died and the title has fallen to me. My
fortune is now ample and we can live quietly
on our estates. The world has little to attract
me outside of domestic happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the sentiments that I have always held
in my heart, and which no worldly conditions
can change, believe me to be</p>

<p>&#8220;With sentiments of my tenderest love, your
faithful and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Roderick Barclugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mollie Greydon,<br />
<span class="gap">Dorminghurst, Penn., N. A.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>As the motto on Barclugh&#8217;s seal says, &#8220;After
darkness there is light,&#8221; so Mollie read and re-read
his sweet words with increasing delight. Her soul
was athirst for what he said. But what would
papa say?</p>

<p>After many family councils in the Doctor&#8217;s office,
at last Doctor Greydon gave his consent under
one condition, which was: that Roderick Barclugh
would come to America and take the ups and
downs of a common American and rear his
family as free American citizens.</p>

<p>Mollie wrote her lover after she had time to
consider the meaning of it all, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">Dorminghurst,<br />
October 30, 178&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Barclugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret that my words can not properly
convey my sentiments in support of your noble
acts in giving justice to our struggling Colonies.
My father feels grateful to you for what you
have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the part that you took in the drama
of war, our Segwuna says that you were a
messenger sent by the Great Spirit to learn the
truth about our people and to convey it across the
sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;My feelings for you have always been of the
tenderest nature and I know that I could love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
honor you as your noble spirit deserves.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one consideration that I can
ask before I pledge you my honor and my life:</p>

<p>&#8220;My people left England to escape the perfidy
of aristocratical distinctions in society. If you
were plain Roderick Barclugh and could come
and live our simple life in America, my heart
would rejoice to be your bride. But for me to
return to England, a titled person, I would be
sacrificing the principles of three generations
of my forefathers and I should always feel guilty
of treachery to my dearest family ties. Thus it
would be a mistake to try to make me happy and
we had better bide apart although it would break
my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you could come to America and we should
be wedded simply as Roderick Barclugh and
Mollie Greydon my heart would rejoice and I
am sure God would prosper us in our journey
through life.</p>

<p>&#8220;With my tenderest affection and esteem,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="gapright">&#8220;As ever yours,</span><br />

&#8220;Mollie Greydon.</p>

<p>
&#8220;Sir Roderick Barclugh, Bart,<br />
<span class="gap">&#8220;Devon House,</span><br />
<span class="gap2">&#8220;Devonshire, England.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the course of two months, Sir Roderick
Barclugh received the answer that Mollie penned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
and when he read its contents, he kissed the
paper that held the precious words, and as soon
as the war closed, after Cornwallis&#8217;s surrender,
he immediately took steps to transfer his baronetcy
to his next of kin and made all arrangements to
wed Mollie Greydon in the following spring.</p>

<p>He did not forget to do justice to Mrs. Arnold
and her children before he left England or resigned
his title.</p>

<p>He secured a pension for Mrs. Arnold of three
hundred pounds sterling yearly and one hundred
pounds yearly for each of Arnold&#8217;s children.
He felt the responsibility for Arnold&#8217;s rash deed
to a very great degree.</p>

<p>In the balmy days of June following, the
old mansion of Dorminghurst was gay with the
prospects of the wedding of its jewel.</p>

<p>The old hemlocks seemed greener than ever
and the lover&#8217;s walk and the old mill had its
attractions for Mollie and Roderick in the prenuptial
days.</p>

<p>The wedding was celebrated in high pomp
(for the Greydons had practically gone back
to the established church) by the Reverend Mr.
White, the Chaplain of Congress.</p>

<p>The war was over and the people were united.
The drama of the strife was past. Peace and its
pursuits held sway.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>Roderick Barclugh and his bride emigrated
over the Alleghanies and took up lands in the
blue-grass region of Kentucky, where they lived
in happiness and contentment, rearing a large
family.</p>

<p>Their love for fine horses brought the line of
thoroughbreds that distinguishes the soil of the
State of &#8220;the dark and bloody ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>The descendants of the Barclughs have spread
throughout the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi,
and they have ever shone in the councils
of our nation, being noted for their integrity,
loyalty and patriotism.</p>
